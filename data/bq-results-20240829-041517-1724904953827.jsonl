{"abstract":"Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, predominantly at night, and plays a pivotal role in regulating the circadian rhythm as well as a variety of biological functions, including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity, and preservation of endothelial cell function. The intrarenal renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most important contributors in the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, independent of the circulating RAS, due to sodium reabsorption and inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney. However, the relationship between melatonin secretion and intrarenal RAS activation has remained unknown. It has been recently shown that impaired nighttime melatonin secretion is associated with nighttime urinary angiotensinogen excretion, a surrogate marker of intrarenal RAS activation and renal damage in patients with CKD. Moreover, it has also been indicated that melatonin administered exogenously exercises antioxidant effects that ameliorate intrarenal RAS activation and renal injury in chronic progressive CKD animal models. As a result, the new roles of melatonin in suppressing RAS in the kidney via amelioration of reactive oxygen species have been clarified. Therefore, we review the relationship between melatonin and intrarenal RAS activation and indicate the possibility of a new strategy to suppress CKD, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular and end-stage renal diseases.","authors":"Naro Ohashi; Sayaka Ishigaki; Shinsuke Isobe","keywords":"Medicine/Public Health, general; Internal Medicine; Public Health; Geriatrics/Gerontology; Obstetrics/Perinatology/Midwifery; Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","organization_affiliated":"Internal Medicine 1, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku Hamamatsu, Japan; Blood Purification Unit, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku Hamamatsu, Japan; Internal Medicine 1, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku Hamamatsu, Japan","title":"The pivotal role of melatonin in ameliorating chronic kidney disease by suppression of the renin–angiotensin system in the kidney","id":"e08c8e11-2fa3-4f69-86d1-85394f5c21d6"}
{"abstract":"In general, Friedel-Crafts reaction is incompatible with amines due to the Lewis acidity of the catalysts. Recently, we reported that cyclic diaminocarbene-Gold(I) can be used as catalyst for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation between aromatic amines and alkenes. Herein, a systematically theoretical research was performed on this rare Friedel-Crafts reaction. The adopted calculation method is accurate enough to reproduce the crystal structure of the catalyst. It was found that the reactions followed the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism. The gold cation can activate the C=C double bond and generate the electrophilic group which can be attacked by the aromatic ring. The para-product is more energy favorable which agrees well with the experimental results. The reaction of α-methylstyrene follows the Markovnikov rule, and the activation energy to generate the branched product of methylstyrene is lower than that producing the linear product. However, the reaction of butanone follows the anti-Markovnikov rule, and the activation energy to generate the branched product of butanone is higher than that producing the linear product. These calculation results reveal the mechanism of this new Friedel-Crafts reaction. It can well explain the high para-selectivity and the substrate-dependent of the product structures in the experiment.","authors":"Hangzhi Wu; Tianxiang Zhao; Xingbang Hu","keywords":"Catalytic mechanisms; Reaction mechanisms","organization_affiliated":"High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, P.

{"abstract":"Increased ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation due to global change can affect plant growth and metabolism. Here, we evaluated the capacity of quinoa to resist under short acute UVB irradiation. Quinoa was daily exposed for 30 or 60 min to 1.69 W m−2 UVB. The results showed that 30 min exposure in 9 d-course did not cause severe alterations on photosynthetic pigments and flavonoids, but a significant increase of antioxidant capacity was observed. Otherwise, 60 min UVB in 5 d-course reduced almost all these parameters except for an increase in the de-epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments and led to the death of the plants. Further studies of gas exchange and fluorescence measurements showed that 30 min UVB dramatically decrease stomatal conductance, probably associated to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport was also observed, which could be a response to reduce ROS. Otherwise, irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus was found with 60 min UVB probably due to severe ROS overproduction that decompensates the redox balance inducing UVB non-specific signaling. Moreover, 60 min UVB compromised Rubisco carboxylase activity and photosynthetic electron transport. Overall, these data suggest that quinoa modulates different response mechanisms depending on the UVB irradiation dosage.","authors":"Thais Huarancca Reyes; Andrea Scartazza; Antonella Castagna; Eric G.

{"abstract":"Secondhand smoke exposure of non-smoking women during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, the available evidence regarding the association between expectant mothers’ secondhand smoke exposure and breastfeeding outcomes remains limited. This systematic review aimed to examine associations between secondhand smoke exposure of nonsmoking women during pregnancy with the initiation, prevalence, and duration or breastfeeding compared to women who were breastfeeding and had not been exposed to secondhand smoke. Women who smoked during pregnancy were excluded. We included case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies with a comparison control group. Medline CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched in January 2017. After screening 2777 records we included eight prospective cohort studies. The risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies indicated a high risk of outcome assessment blinding. Meta-analysis of two studies established that the odds of discontinuation of any brestfeeding before six months were significantly increased in the secondhand smoke exposed women (pooled odds = 1.07 [95%CI = 1.01, 1.14], two studies, 1382 women). Therefore, secondhand smoke might be associated with discontinuing any breastfeeding before six months. More research is necessary to understand the association between secondhand smoke and the initiation, prevalence and duration of breastfeeding.","authors":"Daichi Suzuki; Windy M. V.

Therefore, we aimed to characterize cefazolin PK in infants aged ≤32 weeks of gestation at birth. We conducted a prospective, open-label PK and safety study of cefazolin in infants ≤32 weeks gestation from a University Medical Center. We administered intravenous cefazolin and collected both timed and scavenged blood samples. We analyzed data using non-linear mixed effect modeling and simulated several dosage regimens to achieve target concentrations against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. We analyzed 40 samples from nine infants and observed that premature infants had lower clearance and greater volume of distribution for cefazolin compared to older children. The median (range) individual Bayesian estimates were 0.03 L/h/kg (0.01–0.08) for clearance and 0.39 L/kg (0.31–0.52) for volume. Simulations suggested reduced cefazolin dosing based on postmenstrual age achieve target concentrations and potentially reduce unnecessary exposure.","authors":"Stephen J. Balevic; P.

{"abstract":"The prototypical metal-insulator transition in VO2 at 340 K is from a high-temperature rutile phase to a low-temperature monoclinic phase. The lower symmetry of the monoclinic structure removes the degeneracy of the two equivalent directions of the tetragonal structure, giving rise to twin domains. Since formation of domain walls require energy most needle-like monoclinic single crystal are single-domain. The mixed metal-insulator state in self-heated needle-like single crystals exhibits various domain patterns, the most remarkable being static insulating triangular domains embedded in the metal and narrow insulating domains sliding along the metallic background in the direction of the electric current. Reported here are results obtained for some rare needle-like twinned VO2 single crystals. Such sample revealed a unique feature: joint static triangular twins emit sliding twin domains, first overlapping and later disjoining. Dark and bright twins and dim metallic background were seen for optimal orientation under a microscope, due to polarization by reflection.","authors":"Bertina Fisher; Larisa Patlagan; George M.

{"abstract":"Although TRAIL can directly induce cell death in some cancer cells, it appears that TRAIL resistance exists in many cancers. This study focuses on anti-cancer drugs for TRAIL-resistant head and neck cancer (HNC) to provide further progress toward effective cancer therapy. Results indicate in TRAIL-resistant HNC cells, that combined TRAIL and VPA treatment greatly reduced cell viability and therefore induced cell death, relative to treatment with TRAIL or VPA alone. A caspase-dependent signaling pathway was demonstrated, and combined treatment with TRAIL and VPA also significantly decreased the expression of HDAC4. When we pretreated cells with z-VAD followed by combined treatment with TRAIL and VPA, cell death was blocked with no reduction in expression of HDAC4. To confirm that cell death involved HDAC4 in HNC cells, we knocked down expression of HDAC4 with siRNA, followed by treatment with TRAIL and VPA. Results showed that loss of HDAC4 sensitized the TRAIL-resistant HNC cells to apoptotic cell death. Finally, we showed elevated expression of HDAC4 in HNC tissues compared to normal tissues obtained from the same patients. In conclusion, we suggest that combined VPA and TRAIL treatment may be a promising therapy for HNC via HDAC4 degradation.","authors":"Bok-Soon Lee; Yeon Soo Kim; Haeng-Jun Kim; Dae-Ho Kim; Ho-Ryun Won; Yong-Sung Kim; Chul-Ho Kim","keywords":"Head and neck cancer; Single-molecule biophysics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, College of Medicine, Konyang University Hospital, Konyang University Myunggok Medical Research Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Research Institute for Medical Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea","title":"HDAC4 degradation by combined TRAIL and valproic acid treatment induces apoptotic cell death of TRAIL-resistant head and neck cancer cells","id":"aebdea07-0f4c-4484-8d0a-164f25f74cab"}
{"abstract":"For phase-change cooling schemes for electronics, quick activation of nucleate boiling helps safeguard the electronics components from thermal shocks associated with undesired surface superheating at boiling incipience, which is of great importance to the long-term system stability and reliability. Previous experimental studies show that bubble nucleation can occur surprisingly early on mixed-wettability surfaces. In this paper, we report unambiguous evidence that such unusual bubble generation at extremely low temperatures—even below the boiling point—is induced by a significant presence of incondensable gas retained by the hydrophobic surface, which exhibits exceptional stability even surviving extensive boiling deaeration. By means of high-speed imaging, it is revealed that the consequently gassy boiling leads to unique bubble behaviour that stands in sharp contrast with that of pure vapour bubbles. Such findings agree qualitatively well with numerical simulations based on a diffuse-interface method. Moreover, the simulations further demonstrate strong thermocapillary flows accompanying growing bubbles with considerable gas contents, which is associated with heat transfer enhancement on the biphilic surface in the low-superheat region.","authors":"Biao Shen; Masayuki Yamada; Sumitomo Hidaka; Jiewei Liu; Junichiro Shiomi; Gustav Amberg; Minh Do-Quang; Masamichi Kohno; Koji Takahashi; Yasuyuki Takata","keywords":"Fluid dynamics; Mechanical engineering","organization_affiliated":"International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanics, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanics, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Mechanics, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden; International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyushu University, Nishi-ku, Japan","title":"Early Onset of Nucleate Boiling on Gas-covered Biphilic Surfaces","id":"89583fdd-d1a2-4fd6-bb7d-a30558a923a7"}
{"abstract":"Cell therapy using renal progenitors differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has the potential to significantly reduce the number of patients receiving dialysis therapy. However, the differentiation cultures may contain undifferentiated or undesired cell types that cause unwanted side effects, such as neoplastic formation, when transplanted into a body. Moreover, the hESCs/iPSCs are often genetically modified in order to isolate the derived renal progenitors, hampering clinical applications. To establish an isolation method for renal progenitors induced from hESCs/iPSCs without genetic modifications, we screened antibodies against cell surface markers. We identified the combination of four markers, CD9−CD140a+CD140b+CD271+, which could enrich OSR1+SIX2+ renal progenitors. Furthermore, these isolated cells ameliorated renal injury in an acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model when used for cell therapy. These cells could contribute to the development of hiPSC-based cell therapy and disease modeling against kidney diseases.","authors":"Azusa Hoshina; Tatsuya Kawamoto; Shin-Ichi Sueta; Shin-Ichi Mae; Toshikazu Araoka; Hiromi Tanaka; Yasunori Sato; Yukiko Yamagishi; Kenji Osafune","keywords":"Induced pluripotent stem cells; Stem-cell differentiation","organization_affiliated":"Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Global Clinical Research, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan; Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan","title":"Development of new method to enrich human iPSC-derived renal progenitors using cell surface markers","id":"9287c952-857f-4669-8493-667795580a5f"}

{"abstract":"Mitral cells are major projection neurons of the olfactory bulb (OB) that form an axonal bundle known as the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). After axonal bundle formation, collateral branches sprout from primary axons of the LOT. Recently, we identified LOT usher substance (LOTUS) as an endogenous Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) antagonist and demonstrated that LOTUS contributes to the formation of the LOT axonal bundle. Immunoblots revealed that the expression level of Nogo-A in the OB developmentally increased during axonal collateral formation. Next, we found that the axonal collateral branches were increased in cultured OB neurons from LOTUS-knockout (KO) mice, whereas they were decreased in cultured OB neurons from NgR1-KO mice. Knockdown of Nogo-A in cultured OB neurons reduced the number of axonal collateral branches, suggesting that endogenous Nogo-A induces axonal branching. Finally, the collateral branches of the LOT were increased in LOTUS-KO mice, whereas those in NgR1-KO mice were decreased. Moreover, the abnormal increase of axonal branching observed in LOTUS-KO mice was rescued in the double mutant of LOTUS- and NgR1-KO mice. These findings suggest that Nogo-A and NgR1 interactions may contribute to axonal branching in LOT development.","authors":"Masumi Iketani; Takaakira Yokoyama; Yuji Kurihara; Stephen M.

{"abstract":"CD20 is a B-lymphocyte specific integral membrane protein, an activated-glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of B-cells and a clinically validated target of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab in the treatment of all B cell lymphomas and leukemias as well as autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the extraction and purification of native CD20 from SUDHL4 and RAMOS cell lines. To improve the protein yield, we applied a calixarene-based detergent approach to solubilize, stabilize and purify native CD20 from HEK293 cells. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Analytical Ultracentrifugation show that purified CD20 was non-aggregated and that CD20 oligomerization is concentration dependent. Negative stain electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed homogenous populations of CD20. However, no defined structure could be observed. Interestingly, micellar solubilized and purified CD20 particles adopt uniformly confined nanodroplets which do not fuse and aggregate. Finally, purified CD20 could bind to rituximab and obinutuzumab as demonstrated by SEC, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Specificity of binding was confirmed using CD20 antibody mutants to human B-cell lymphoma cells. The strategy described in this work will help investigate CD20 binding with newly developed antibodies and eventually help to optimize them. This approach may also be applicable to other challenging membrane proteins.","authors":"Morgane Agez; Elodie Desuzinges Mandon; Thomas Iwema; Reto Gianotti; Florian Limani; Sylvia Herter; Ekkehard Mössner; Eric A.

Here, site directed mutagenesis at the corresponding Bacillus subtilis PolX (PolXBs) residues, Arg469, Arg474, Asn498, Arg503 and Lys545, as well as to the highly conserved residue Phe440 gave rise to enzymes severely affected in all the nucleolytic activities of the enzyme while conserving a wild-type gap-filling activity, indicating a function of those residues in DNA binding at the PHP domain. Altogether, the results obtained with the mutant proteins, the spatial arrangement of those DNA binding residues, the intermolecular transference of the 3′-terminus between the PHP and polymerization active sites, and the available 3D structures of bacterial PolXs led us to propose the requirement to a great degree of a functional/structural flexibility to coordinate the synthetic and degradative activities in these enzymes.","authors":"Guillermo Rodríguez; María Teresa Martín; Miguel de Vega","keywords":"DNA damage and repair; Enzymes","organization_affiliated":"Centro de Biología Molecular “Severo Ochoa” (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain; Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas), Madrid, Spain; Centro de Biología Molecular “Severo Ochoa” (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain","title":"An array of basic residues is essential for the nucleolytic activity of the PHP domain of bacterial/archaeal PolX DNA polymerases","id":"f1333a71-2d26-4fce-bb1a-ddb7f8e449b7"}

The behavioral results showed high state anxiety levels increased the d’ of negative words, regardless of the trait anxiety of participant is high or low, and a lower d’ of recognition memory for negative words than for neutral and positive words in all participants. Moreover, Electrophysiological results supported the findings of behavior, showing an earlier N400 (250–500 ms) latency elicited for new-negative words in high state level than in low state levels in right parietal region.

In multivariate analysis CHM resulted an independent prognostic factor. The hazard ratio was 0.103 (95% confidence interval = 0.064–0.164; P \u003c 0.001). Compared with the non-CHM group, the median survival time of the CHM group was also improved (40 versus 12 months; P \u003c 0.001). Eighteen out of 295 herbs showed significant correlation with survival results (P \u003c 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the 18 herbs realize anti-CRC activity mainly through suppressing the proliferative activity of ERBB2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and retinoid X receptor, suppressing angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR and VEGFA expression, inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT1 signaling pathway directly through SRC and AKT1, and reducing tumor necrosis factor-induced inflammation.","authors":"Hongxu Zhu; Jian Hao; Yangyang Niu; Dan Liu; Dan Chen; Xiongzhi Wu","keywords":"Drug development; Target identification","organization_affiliated":"Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Children’s Hospital, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Zhong-Shan-Men Inpatient Department, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China","title":"Molecular targets of Chinese herbs: a clinical study of metastatic colorectal cancer based on network pharmacology","id":"8e98b05a-e975-4444-9f66-1b9213cac580"}
{"abstract":"The effects of stacking periodicity on the electronic and optical properties of GaAs/AlAs superlattice have been explored by density functional theory calculations. Among the (GaAs)m/(AlAs)m, (GaAs)1/(AlAs)m and (GaAs)m/(AlAs)1 (m = 1 to 5) superlattices, the band gaps of (GaAs)m/(AlAs)1 superlattices decrease significantly as the layer of GaAs increases, and the cut-off wavelengths are found to locate in the near infrared region. For (GaAs)m/(AlAs)1 SLs, the conduction bands shift toward Fermi level, resulting in the smaller band gap, while conduction bands of (GaAs)1/(AlAs)n SLs slightly shift to higher energy, which lead to comparable band gaps. The layer number of GaAs shows negligible effects on the reflectivity spectra of superlattice structures, while the absorption coefficient shows a red-shift with the increasing layer of GaAs, which is beneficial for the application of GaAs/AlAs superlattice in the field of near infrared detector. These results demonstrate that controlling the number of GaAs layers is a good method to engineer the optoelectronic properties of GaAs/AlAs superlattice.","authors":"M. Jiang; H. Y. Xiao; S. M.

{"abstract":"Breast cancer is an increasing problem in Asia, with a higher proportion of premenopausal patients who are at higher risk of recurrence. Targeted sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from primary tumor specimens of 63 premenopausal Asian patients who relapsed after initial diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer. The most prevalent alterations included: TP53 (65%); PIK3CA (32%); GATA3 (29%); ERBB2 (27%); MYC (25%); KMT2C (21%); MCL1 (17%); PRKDC, TPR, BRIP1 (14%); MDM4, PCDH15, PRKAR1A, CDKN1B (13%); CCND1, KMT2D, STK11, and MLH1 (11%). Sixty of the 63 patients (95%) had at least one genetic alteration in a signaling pathway related to cell cycle or p53 signaling. The presence of MCL1 amplification, HIF-1-alpha transcription factor network pathway alterations, and direct p53 effectors pathway alterations were independent predictors of inferior overall survival from initial diagnosis. Comparison with non-Asian premenopausal tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a higher prevalence of TP53 mutations among HER2-positive cancers, and more frequent TP53, TET2, and CDK12 mutations among hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative cancers in our cohort. Given the limited number of non-Asian premenopausal breast cancers that had relapsed in TCGA, we compared the frequency of mutations in our cohort with 43 premenopausal specimens from both TCGA and International Cancer Genome Consortium that had relapsed. There was a trend toward higher prevalence of TP53 mutations in our cohort. Certain genomic aberrations may be enriched in tumors of poor-prognosis premenopausal Asian breast cancers. The development of novel therapies targeting these aberrations merit further research. Younger women in Asia with recurrent breast cancer seem to have a higher rate of mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 than do women elsewhere—a finding that could guide drug development in Asia. Yoon-Sim Yap from the\u2028 National Cancer Centre Singapore and coworkers sequenced DNA extracted from the tumor samples of 63 premenopausal women from Singapore and South Korea who relapsed following treatment for non-metastatic breast cancer. The researchers analyzed hundreds of cancer-related genes, and found that the vast majority of women harbored mutations in at least one gene linked to regulating the cell cycle of TP53 signaling. The prevalence of mutations in certain genes, including TP53 itself, was higher than observed previously in non-Asian cohorts, highlighting the need to consider ethnic diversity in genomic studies of breast cancer and in drug development.","authors":"Yoon-Sim Yap; Angad P.

{"abstract":"Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) can be susceptible, at least transiently, to treatments with azidothymidine (AZT) plus IFNα and/or arsenic trioxide. However, the real role of AZT in this effect is still unclear. In fact, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition could explain reduction of clonal expansion and of renewal of HTLV-1 infected cells during ATL progression, this effect alone seems insufficient to justify the evident and prompt decrease of the pro-viral load in treated patients. We have previously demonstrated that AZT is endowed with an intrinsic pro-apoptotic potential towards both peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors or some tumor cell lines, but this cytotoxic potential cannot be fully achieved unless IκBα phosphorylation is inhibited. Since the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B (NF-κB) appears a common biological basis of HTLV-1-infected cells, a pharmacological inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation seems a potential strategy for treating and preventing HTLV-1 related pathologies. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination treatment with the IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor Bay 11-7085 and AZT induced increased levels of regulated cell death (RCD) by apoptosis compared to the single treatments in HTLV-1 infected cells of different origin. Importantly, levels of RCD were considerably higher in infected cells in comparison with the uninfected ones. Inhibition of NF-κB activation following the combined treatment was confirmed by analysis of both gel-shift and functional activity of the NF-κB complex proteins, p65/p52. Moreover, a transcriptional analysis revealed that the addition of Bay 11-7085 to AZT treatment in HTLV-1-infected cells modified their transcriptional profile, by inducing the upregulation of some pro-apoptotic genes together with the downregulation of some anti-apoptotic genes. Our data suggest that addition of adequate concentrations of IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor to therapeutic regimens including AZT could be a promising strategy in ATL.","authors":"Claudia Matteucci; Francesca Marino-Merlo; Antonella Minutolo; Emanuela Balestrieri; Elena Valletta; Beatrice Macchi; Antonio Mastino; Sandro Grelli","keywords":"Cancer therapy; Preclinical research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy; IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo, Messina, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy; Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy; Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical, and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy; The Institute of Translational Pharmacology, CNR, Rome, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy","title":"Inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation potentiates regulated cell death induced by azidothymidine in HTLV-1 infected cells","id":"5bcf5fd3-a5b5-488c-9884-240668993f78"}

{"abstract":"Among many populations of blood cells, high dimensional analysis using mass cytometry reveals classical monocyte frequency as strong predictors of response to PD-1 blockade therapy of melanoma. Immune-checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer therapy. In particular, inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has been found to be effective for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and other cancers. Despite a dramatic increase in progression-free survival, a large proportion of patients do not show durable responses. Therefore, predictive biomarkers of a clinical response are urgently needed. Here we used high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline for the in-depth characterization of the immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with stage IV melanoma before and after 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. During therapy, we observed a clear response to immunotherapy in the T cell compartment. However, before commencing therapy, a strong predictor of progression-free and overall survival in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the frequency of CD14+CD16−HLA-DRhi monocytes. We confirmed this by conventional flow cytometry in an independent, blinded validation cohort, and we propose that the frequency of monocytes in PBMCs may serve in clinical decision support.","authors":"Carsten Krieg; Malgorzata Nowicka; Silvia Guglietta; Sabrina Schindler; Felix J Hartmann; Lukas M Weber; Reinhard Dummer; Mark D Robinson; Mitchell P Levesque; Burkhard Becher","keywords":"Cancer immunotherapy; Predictive markers","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Department of Dermatology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","title":"High-dimensional single-cell analysis predicts response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy","id":"ec8200c2-1bb5-4dc5-9444-ae6767511824"}
{"abstract":"Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) have been widely studied, yet there is a lack of understanding with regards to the final size and properties of these networks, mainly due to no network currently being complete. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of GRN structural properties across a large set of distinct prokaryotic organisms and found a set of constrained characteristics such as network density and number of regulators. Our results allowed us to estimate the number of interactions that complete networks would have, a valuable insight that could aid in the daunting task of network curation, prediction, and validation. Using state-of-the-art statistical approaches, we also provided new evidence to settle a previously stated controversy that raised the possibility of complete biological networks being random and therefore attributing the observed scale-free properties to an artifact emerging from the sampling process during network discovery. Furthermore, we identified a set of properties that enabled us to assess the consistency of the connectivity distribution for various GRNs against different alternative statistical distributions. Our results favor the hypothesis that highly connected nodes (hubs) are not a consequence of network incompleteness. Finally, an interaction coverage computed for the GRNs as a proxy for completeness revealed that high-throughput based reconstructions of GRNs could yield biased networks with a low average clustering coefficient, showing that classical targeted discovery of interactions is still needed.","authors":"Adrian I.

{"abstract":"The structure of the VO subcomplex of yeast V-ATPase, solved by electron cryomicroscopy, reveals a new subunit and suggests a mechanism for the translocation of protons across membranes. The cell powers many cellular processes by pumping protons through membrane-embedded rotary ATPases. It has been difficult to determine the structure of a physiological ATPase complex, given the membrane association. John Rubinstein and colleagues have now solved this problem, and determine the structure of the VO complex of the yeast vacuolar ATPase within a membrane. At approximately 3.9 Å, the resolution of the structure is sufficient to permit the authors to propose a previously unidentified subunit. Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-powered proton pumps involved in processes such as endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, secondary transport, TOR signalling, and osteoclast and kidney function. ATP hydrolysis in the soluble catalytic V1 region drives proton translocation through the membrane-embedded VO region via rotation of a rotor subcomplex. Variability in the structure of the intact enzyme has prevented construction of an atomic model for the membrane-embedded motor of any rotary ATPase1,2,3,4,5. We induced dissociation and auto-inhibition of the V1 and VO regions of the V-ATPase by starving the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae6,7, allowing us to obtain a ~3.9-Å resolution electron cryomicroscopy map of the VO complex and build atomic models for the majority of its subunits. The analysis reveals the structures of subunits ac8c′c″de and a protein that we identify and propose to be a new subunit (subunit f). A large cavity between subunit a and the c-ring creates a cytoplasmic half-channel for protons. The c-ring has an asymmetric distribution of proton-carrying Glu residues, with the Glu residue of subunit c″ interacting with Arg735 of subunit a. The structure suggests sequential protonation and deprotonation of the c-ring, with ATP-hydrolysis-driven rotation causing protonation of a Glu residue at the cytoplasmic half-channel and subsequent deprotonation of a Glu residue at a luminal half-channel.","authors":"Mohammad T.

{"abstract":"High temperature requirement factor A3 (HtrA3), a member of the HtrA protease family, is highly expressed in the developing placenta, including the maternal decidual cells in both mice and humans. In this study we deleted the HtrA3 gene in the mouse and crossed females carrying zero, one, or two HtrA3-expressing alleles with HtrA3+/− males to investigate the role of maternal vs fetal HtrA3 in placentation. Although HtrA3−/− mice were phenotypically normal and fertile, HtrA3 deletion in the mother resulted in intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). Disorganization of labyrinthine fetal capillaries was the major placental defect when HtrA3 was absent. The IUGR caused by maternal HtrA3 deletion, albeit being mild, significantly altered offspring growth trajectory long after birth. By 8 months of age, mice born to HtrA3-deficient mothers, independent of their own genotype, were significantly heavier and contained a larger mass of white fat. We further demonstrated that in women serum levels of HtrA3 during early pregnancy were significantly lower in IUGR pregnancies, establishing an association between lower HtrA3 levels and placental insufficiency in the human. This study thus revealed the importance of maternal HtrA3 in optimizing placental development and its long-term impact on the offspring well beyond in utero growth.","authors":"Ying Li; Lois A.

{"abstract":"Early detection of the onset of a caldera collapse can provide crucial information to understand their formation and thus to minimize risks for the nearby population and visitors. Here, we analyse the 2007 caldera collapse of Piton de la Fournaise on La Réunion Island recorded by a broadband seismic station. We show that this instrument recorded ultra-long period (ULP) signals with frequencies in the range (0.003–0.01 Hz) accompanied by very-long period (VLP) signals (between 0.02 and 0.50 Hz) prior to and during the caldera formation suggesting it is possible to detect the beginning of the collapse at depth and anticipate its surface formation. Interestingly, VLP wave packets with a similar duration of 20 s are identified prior to and during the caldera formation. We propose that these events could result from repeating piston-like successive collapses occurring through a ring-fault structure surrounding a magma reservoir from the following arguments: the source mechanism from the main collapse, the observations of slow source processes as well as observations from the field and the characteristic ring-fault seismicity.","authors":"F.

{"abstract":"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion in humans, with highly variable phenotypic expression. Whereas congenital heart defects, palatal anomalies, immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and neuropsychiatric conditions are observed in over 50% of patients with 22q11DS, a subset of patients present with additional “atypical” findings such as craniosynostosis and anorectal malformations. Recently, pathogenic variants in the CDC45 (Cell Division Cycle protein 45) gene, located within the LCR22A–LCR22B region of chromosome 22q11.2, were noted to be involved in the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis. We performed next-generation sequencing on DNA from 15 patients with 22q11.2DS and atypical phenotypic features such as craniosynostosis, short stature, skeletal differences, and anorectal malformations. We identified four novel rare nonsynonymous variants in CDC45 in 5/15 patients with 22q11.2DS and craniosynostosis and/or other atypical findings. This study supports CDC45 as a causative gene in craniosynostosis, as well as a number of other anomalies. We suggest that this association results in a condition independent of Meier–Gorlin syndrome, perhaps representing a novel condition and/or a cause of features associated with Baller–Gerold syndrome. In addition, this work confirms that the phenotypic variability observed in a subset of patients with 22q11.2DS is due to pathogenic variants on the nondeleted chromosome.","authors":"Marta Unolt; Molka Kammoun; Beata Nowakowska; Gail E.

{"abstract":"Stephacidin A and its congeners are a collection of secondary metabolites that possess intriguing structural motifs. They stem from unusual biosynthetic sequences that lead to the incorporation of a prenyl or reverse-prenyl group into a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane framework, a chromene unit or the vestige thereof. To complement biosynthetic studies, which normally play a significant role in unveiling the biosynthetic pathways of natural products, here we demonstrate that chemical synthesis can provide important insights into biosynthesis. We identify a short total synthesis of congeners in the reverse-prenylated indole alkaloid family related to stephacidin A by taking advantage of a direct indole C6 halogenation of the related ketopremalbrancheamide. This novel strategic approach has now made possible the syntheses of several natural products, including malbrancheamides B and C, notoamides F, I and R, aspergamide B, and waikialoid A, which is a heterodimer of avrainvillamide and aspergamide B. Our approach to the preparation of these prenylated and reverse-prenylated indole alkaloids is bioinspired, and may also inform the as-yet undetermined biosynthesis of several congeners. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as stephacidin A and its congeners continues to intrigue both biochemists and synthetic chemists. Now, a laboratory chemical synthesis of these natural products has been achieved based on a bioinspired synthetic strategy, which may provide key insights into the possible biosynthesis of these captivating molecules.","authors":"Ken Mukai; Danilo Pereira de Sant'Ana; Yasuo Hirooka; Eduardo V.

{"abstract":"Invadosomes are F-actin-based structures involved in extracellular matrix degradation, cell invasion, and metastasis formation. Analyzing their proteome is crucial to decipher their molecular composition, to understand their mechanisms, and to find specific elements to target them. However, the specific analysis of invadosomes is challenging, because it is difficult to maintain their integrity during isolation. In addition, classical purification methods often suffer from contaminations, which may impair data validation. To ensure the specific identification of invadosome components, we here develop a method that combines laser microdissection and mass spectrometry, enabling the analysis of subcellular structures in their native state based on low amounts of input material. Using this combinatorial method, we show that invadosomes contain specific components of the translational machinery, in addition to known marker proteins. Moreover, functional validation reveals that protein translation activity is an inherent property of invadosomes, which is required to maintain invadosome structure and activity. Invadosomes degrade extracellular matrix and facilitate cell invasion but their molecular composition is not fully understood. Here, the authors combine laser capture and mass spectrometry to map the proteome of invadosomes, showing that they rely on internal translational activity to maintain their structure.","authors":"Zakaria Ezzoukhry; Elodie Henriet; Fabrice P.

{"abstract":"Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most ubiquitous connexin in various cells, and presents as hemichannels (HCs) and gap junctions (GJs) on the cell membrane. We have recently shown that Cx43 abundance was strongly reduced in fibroblasts of human gingival wounds, and blocking Cx43 function in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (GFBLs) strongly regulated the expression of wound healing-related genes. However, it is not known whether these responses involved Cx43 HCs or GJs. Here we show that Cx43 assembled into distinct GJ and HC plaques in GFBLs both in vivo and in vitro. Specific blockage of Cx43 HC function by TAT-Gap19, a Cx43 mimetic peptide, significantly upregulated the expression of several MMPs, TGF-β signaling molecules, Tenascin-﻿C, and VEGF-A, while pro-fibrotic molecules, including several extracellular matrix proteins and myofibroblast and cell contractility-related molecules, were significantly downregulated. These changes were linked with TAT-Gap19-induced suppression of ATP signaling and activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that reduced Cx43 HC function could promote fast and scarless gingival wound healing. Thus, selective suppression of Cx43 HCs may provide a novel target to modulate wound healing.","authors":"Rana Tarzemany; Guoqiao Jiang; Jean X.

{"abstract":" Streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of the tooth surface and competes with oral pathogens such as Streptococcus mutans to maintain oral health. However, little is known about its mechanism of biofilm formation. Here, we show that mutation of the ciaR gene, encoding the response regulator of the CiaRH two-component system in S. sanguinis SK36, produced a fragile biofilm. Cell aggregation, gtfP gene expression and water-insoluble glucan production were all reduced, which suggested polysaccharide production was decreased in ΔciaR. RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR revealed that arginine biosynthesis genes (argR, argB, argC, argG, argH and argJ) and two arginine/histidine permease genes (SSA_1568 and SSA_1569) were upregulated in ΔciaR. In contrast to ΔciaR, most of strains constructed to contain deletions in each of these genes produced more biofilm and water-insoluble glucan than SK36. A ΔciaRΔargB double mutant was completely restored for the gtfP gene expression, glucan production and biofilm formation ability that was lost in ΔciaR, indicating that argB was essential for ciaR to regulate biofilm formation. We conclude that by promoting the expression of arginine biosynthetic genes, especially argB gene, the ciaR mutation reduced polysaccharide production, resulting in the formation of a fragile biofilm in Streptococcus sanguinis.","authors":"Bin Zhu; Xiuchun Ge; Victoria Stone; Xiangzhen Kong; Fadi El-Rami; Yan Liu; Todd Kitten; Ping Xu","keywords":"Bacteriology; Biofilms","organization_affiliated":"Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; College of Biochemical Engineering, Anhui Polytechnic University, Wuhu, China; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology Department, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology Department, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States of America","title":"ciaR impacts biofilm formation by regulating an arginine biosynthesis pathway in Streptococcus sanguinis SK36","id":"212938dc-78e0-4fe7-bf09-ebf6037e5a75"}
{"abstract":"Little is known about the characteristics and clinical implications of specific subsets of intragraft natural killer (NK) cells in kidney transplant recipients. We analyzed 39 for-cause renal transplant biopsies performed at our center from May 2015 to July 2017. According to histopathologic reports, 8 patients (20.5%) had no rejection (NR), 11 (28.2%) had T cell-mediated rejections (TCMR) only, and 20 (51.3%) had antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). NK cells were defined as CD3–CD56+ lymphocytes that are positive for CD57, CD49b, NKG2A, or KIR. The density of NK cells was significantly higher in the ABMR group (2.57 ± 2.58/mm2) than in the NR (0.12 ± 0.22/mm2) or the TCMR (0.25 ± 0.34/mm2) group (P = 0.002). Notably, CD56+CD57+ infiltrates (2.16 ± 1.89) were the most frequently observed compared with CD56+CD49b+ (0.05 ± 0.13), CD56+NKG2A+ (0.21 ± 0.69), and CD56+KIR+ (0.15 ± 0.42) cells in the ABMR group (P \u003c 0.001). Death-censored graft failure was significantly higher in patients with NK cell infiltration than those without (Log-rank test, P = 0.025). In conclusion, CD56+CD57+ infiltrates are a major subset of NK cells in kidney transplant recipients with ABMR and NK cell infiltration is significantly associated with graft failure post-transplant.","authors":"Hey Rim Jung; Mi Joung Kim; Yu-Mee Wee; Jee Yeon Kim; Monica Young Choi; Ji Yoon Choi; Hyunwook Kwon; Joo Hee Jung; Yong Mee Cho; Heounjeong Go; Sang-Yeob Kim; Yeon-Mi Ryu; Yun Jae Kim; Young Hoon Kim; Duck Jong Han; Sung Shin","keywords":"Allotransplantation; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Medical Science, Asan Medical Institute of Convergence Science and Technology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Asan Institute for life sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea; Asan Institute for life sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea; Asan Institute for life sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea","title":"CD56 + CD57 + infiltrates as the most predominant subset of intragraft natural killer cells in renal transplant biopsies with antibody-mediated rejection","id":"77b89de1-78c1-4cfd-ab18-6e13e0ba8cd9"}
{"abstract":"EC1456 is a folate-tubulysin conjugate constructed with an all-D enantiomeric spacer/linker configuration. When tested against folate receptor (FR)-positive cells, EC1456 demonstrated dose-responsive activity with an approximate 1000-fold level of specificity. Treatment of nude mice bearing FR-positive human xenografts (as large as 800 mm3) with non-toxic doses of EC1456 led to cures in 100% of the mice. Combinations of low dose EC1456 with standard of care agents such as platins, taxanes, topotecan and bevacizumab, safely and significantly augmented the growth inhibitory effects of these commonly used agents. When tested against FR-positive human tumor xenograft models having confirmed resistance to a folate-vinca alkaloid (vintafolide), cisplatin or paclitaxel, EC1456 was found to generate partial to curative responses. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that EC1456 has significant anti-proliferative activity against FR-positive tumors, including models which were anticancer drug resistant, thereby justifying a Phase 1 trial of this agent for the treatment of advanced human cancers.","authors":"Joseph A.

{"abstract":"Few treatments have proven effective for patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) in human SCI. This was an open-label prospective clinical trial of aFGF with an extended follow-up to 48 months. All patients were treated with aFGF 3 times, including once directly applied to the injured spinal cord during neurolysis surgery, and twice via lumbar punctures at 3- and 6-months post-operation. Every patient was evaluated with standardized measurements of neurological functions. The trial initially enrolled 60 patients (30 cervical and 30 thoracolumbar SCI), but only 46 (21 cervical- and 25 thoracolumbar-SCI) completed the follow-up. The ASIA impairment scales, motor, pin prick, light touch, and FIM motor subtotal scores were all improved in both groups, except that the ASIA scores of light touch only demonstrated tendency of increase in the cervical-SCI group. All patients had a decrease in dependence, and there were no major adverse events or other oncological problems throughout the follow-up. At 48 months, the study demonstrated that aFGF was safe, feasible, and could yield modest functional improvement in chronic SCI patients. Further randomized control investigations are warranted for validation of its optimal dosage.","authors":"Chin-Chu Ko; Tsung-Hsi Tu; Jau-Ching Wu; Wen-Cheng Huang; Yun-An Tsai; Shih-Fong Huang; Hsueh-Chen Huang; Henrich Cheng","keywords":"Spinal cord diseases; Spinal cord injury","organization_affiliated":"Jhong Jheng Spine \u0026 Orthopedic Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan International Graduate Program in Molecular Medicine, National Yang-Ming University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Neural Regeneration, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Functional improvement in chronic human spinal cord injury: Four years after acidic fibroblast growth factor","id":"58c03155-73fb-4c46-b821-66bea446b246"}

{"abstract":"Regional tree die-off events generate large quantities of standing dead wood, raising concern over catastrophic wildfire and other hazards. Governmental responses to tree die-off have often focused on incentivizing biomass energy production that utilizes standing dead trees removed for safety concerns. However, the full distribution of potential woody bioenergy feedstock after tree die-off has not been evaluated due to the complexities of surveying and precisely measuring large forested areas. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating standing dead biomass at a fine spatial resolution that combines aerial survey data with forest structure maps. Using this method, we quantify biomass generated by the unprecedented tree die-off that occurred in California following a 4-year drought and widespread pest outbreaks. The results are used to estimate feasibly recoverable feedstock for energy production. We find that approximately 95.1 million bone-dry tons (BDT) of dead biomass resulted from 2012–2017 mortality, with a lower bound of 26.2 million BDT. In other words, of the aboveground live tree biomass in 2012, ~1.3–4.8% died by 2017. Of the standing dead biomass, 29% meets minimum constraints for potential cost-effective bioenergy feedstock. This proportion drops to as low as 15% in the most affected areas due to terrain slope, wilderness status, and other factors, highlighting the need to complement disposal via biomass energy with other strategies to mitigate the risks of the tree mortality crisis, which is likely to only become more severe over time due to climate change.","authors":"Carmen L.

{"abstract":"B-Catenin, transcription factor of Wnt signaling, is promoted in patients with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, but Wnt signaling decreases with aging. We hypothesize that IVD degeneration is associated with decreased Wnt signaling despite more b-Catenin. Chronic compression of tail IVDs of young-adult and aged Wnt-reporter (TOPGAL) animals initiated an age-related cascade of degenerative-like changes, which included reduced Wnt ligand expression and Wnt signaling in nucleus pulposus cells, despite elevation of b-Catenin protein and gene expression. To determine the effect of upregulated and downregulated Wnt signaling in adult discs, b-Catenin in the nucleus pulposus was stabilized (Shh-CreErT2/b-Cateninfl(Ex3)/fl(Ex3), cACT) or knocked out (Shh-CreErT2/b-Cateninfl/fl, cKO). cACT discs had promoted expression of Wnt-targets and -ligands, brachyury, extracellular matrix production and 34% greater compressive stiffness than WT (b-Cateninfl(Ex3)/fl(Ex3)) discs, but 50% less tensile stiffness. By contrast, knockout reversed the cACT phenotype: less protein expression of b-catenin in the nucleus pulposus, less expression of brachyury, heightened expression of extracellular matrix breakdown and 46% less compressive stiffness than wild-type (b-Cateninfl/fl,WT) discs. These data suggest that intervertebral disc degeneration is associated with loss of Wnt signaling and that the concomitant increase in b-catenin is a regenerative response, potentially offering a therapeutic approach to degeneration.","authors":"Nilsson Holguin; Matthew J.

{"abstract":"The silver butter catfish (Schilbe intermedius) is widely distributed across African river systems. To date, information on its mitochondrial genetic diversity, population structure, and historical demography are not well-established. Herein, we combined newly generated mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) subunit I gene sequences with previously published COI sequences in the global databases to reconstruct its phylogeography, population genetic structure, and historical demography. Results from the mtDNA phylogeography and species delimitation tests (Cluster algorithm – Species Identifier, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and Poison Tree Process model) revealed that S. intermedius comprises at least seven geographically defined matrilines. Although the overall haplotype diversity of S. intermedius was high (h = 0.90), results showed that East (Kenya) and West (Nigeria) African populations had low levels of haplotype diversity (h = ~0.40). In addition, population genetic polymorphism and historical demographics showed that S. intermedius populations in both East and West Africa underwent severe contractions as a result of biogeographic influences. The patterns of genetic diversity and population structure were consistent with adaptive responses to historical biogeographic factors and contemporary environmental variations across African river systems. This is suggestive of the influence of historical biogeographic factors and climatic conditions on population divergence of S. intermedius across African river systems. Given our discovery of previously underappreciated diversity within S. intermedius, we recommend that this species be considered for increased conservation and management.","authors":"Lotanna M.

Oncological patients and patients receiving interventional therapies were excluded. Data collected included: demographics, aetiology, precipitating cause, injury mechanism, injury site, neurological status (AIS), SCIMIII at admission and discharge, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, depression and hospital length of stay. One thousand two hundred and eighty-two patients were admitted in this period of whom 114 met the inclusion criteria with a median (IQR) age of 58 (45–69) years; 46% female. The prevalence of SCI as a complication following spinal surgery in the total number of patients admitted to our centre was 9%. In 43%, the injury was to the dorsal spine with T12 being the most common neurological level of injury (20% of cases following laminectomy secondary to spinal canal stenosis). The most frequent precipitating cause was epidural haematoma (38% of cases). The median (IQR) SCIMIII scores at admission and discharge were (31) points (20–54) and (67) points (34–81), respectively. General AIS at admission were C (35%) and D at discharge (54%). The presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia adjusted by age was not linked to a higher complication rate. The median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 120 days (60–189). In total 8.9% of patients admitted with SCI were the result of elective spinal surgery.","authors":"L. M. Romero-Muñoz; A.

{"abstract":"Distance decay principles predict that species with larger geographic ranges would have greater intraspecific genetic diversity than more restricted species. However, invasive pest species may not follow this prediction, with confounding implications for tracking phenomena including original ranges, invasion pathways and source populations. We sequenced an 815 base-pair section of the COI gene for 441 specimens of Bactrocera correcta, 214 B. zonata and 372 Zeugodacus cucurbitae; three invasive pest fruit fly species with overlapping hostplants. For each species, we explored how many individuals would need to be included in a study to sample the majority of their haplotype diversity. We also tested for phylogeographic signal and used demographic estimators as a proxy for invasion potency. We find contrasting patterns of haplotype diversity amongst the species, where B. zonata has the highest diversity but most haplotypes were represented by singletons; B. correcta has ~7 dominant haplotypes more evenly distributed; Z. cucurbitae has a single dominant haplotype with closely related singletons in a ‘star-shape’ surrounding it. We discuss how these differing patterns relate to their invasion histories.

Intriguingly, its peripheral vascular and angiogenic powerful activity is strictly associated to platelets, which are source of clinical hemoderivates, such as platelet lysate (PL), routinely employed in several clinical applications as wound healing, and to preserve ex vivo the progenitor properties of the adipose stromal cells pool. So far, the presence of NPY in PL and its biological effects on the adipose stromal cell fraction (ASCs) have never been investigated. Here, we aimed to identify endogenous sources of NPY such as PL-based preparations and to investigate which biological properties PL-derived NPY is able to exert on ASCs. The results show that PL contains a high amount of NPY, which is in part also excreted by ASCs when stimulated with PL. The protein levels of the three main NPY subtype receptors (Y1, Y2, Y5) are unaltered by stimulation of ASCs with PL, but their inhibition through selective pharmacological antagonists, considerably enhances migration, and a parallel reduction of angiogenic features of ASCs including decrease in VEGF mRNA and intracellular calcium levels, both downstream targets of NPY. The expression of VEGF and NPY is enhanced within the sites of neovascularisation of difficult wounds in patients after treatment with leuco-platelet concentrates. Our data highlight the presence of NPY in PL preparations and its peripheral effects on adipose progenitors.","authors":"Rita Businaro; Eleonora Scaccia; Antonella Bordin; Francesca Pagano; Mariangela Corsi; Camilla Siciliano; Raffaele Capoano; Eugenio Procaccini; Bruno Salvati; Vincenzo Petrozza; Pierangela Totta; Maria Teresa Vietri; Giacomo Frati; Elena De Falco","keywords":"Mesenchymal stem cells; Stem-cell research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Medico-surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; Department of Surgical Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Breast Unit, A.O.

{"abstract":"MIF is a chemokine-like cytokine that plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. It binds to the chemokine-receptors CXCR2/CXCR4 to trigger atherogenic leukocyte migration albeit lacking canonical chemokine structures. We recently characterized an N-like-loop and the Pro-2-residue of MIF as critical molecular determinants of the CXCR4/MIF binding-site and identified allosteric agonism as a mechanism that distinguishes CXCR4-binding to MIF from that to the cognate ligand CXCL12. By using peptide spot-array technology, site-directed mutagenesis, structure-activity-relationships, and molecular docking, we identified the Arg-Leu-Arg (RLR) sequence-region 87–89 that – in three-dimensional space – ‘extends’ the N-like-loop to control site-1-binding to CXCR4. Contrary to wildtype MIF, mutant R87A-L88A-R89A-MIF fails to bind to the N-terminal of CXCR4 and the contribution of RLR to the MIF/CXCR4-interaction is underpinned by an ablation of MIF/CXCR4-specific signaling and reduction in CXCR4-dependent chemotactic leukocyte migration of the RLR-mutant of MIF. Alanine-scanning, functional competition by RLR-containing peptides, and molecular docking indicate that the RLR residues directly participate in contacts between MIF and CXCR4 and highlight the importance of charge-interactions at this interface. Identification of the RLR region adds important structural information to the MIF/CXCR4 binding-site that distinguishes this interface from CXCR4/CXCL12 and will help to design MIF-specific drug-targeting approaches.","authors":"Michael Lacy; Christos Kontos; Markus Brandhofer; Kathleen Hille; Sabine Gröning; Dzmitry Sinitski; Priscila Bourilhon; Eric Rosenberg; Christine Krammer; Tharshika Thavayogarajah; Georgios Pantouris; Maria Bakou; Christian Weber; Elias Lolis; Jürgen Bernhagen; Aphrodite Kapurniotu","keywords":"Atherosclerosis; Chemokines","organization_affiliated":"Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Division of Peptide Biochemistry, Technische Universität München, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Division of Peptide Biochemistry, Technische Universität München, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany; Department of Anaesthesiology, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Division of Peptide Biochemistry, Technische Universität München, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany; Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany; Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands; Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Vascular Biology, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology, Munich, Germany; Division of Peptide Biochemistry, Technische Universität München, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany","title":"Identification of an Arg-Leu-Arg tripeptide that contributes to the binding interface between the cytokine MIF and the chemokine receptor CXCR4","id":"2f0afa29-2cfe-43ed-9d5d-30fc006c7039"}
{"abstract":"A noninvasive, effective approach for immediate and painless heart pacing would have invaluable implications in several clinical scenarios. Here we present a novel strategy that utilizes the well-known mechano-electric feedback of the heart to evoke cardiac pacing, while relying on magnetic microparticles as leadless mechanical stimulators. We demonstrate that after localizing intravenously-injected magnetic microparticles in the right ventricular cavity using an external electromagnet, the application of magnetic pulses generates mechanical stimulation that provokes ventricular overdrive pacing in the rat heart. This temporary pacing consistently managed to revert drug-induced bradycardia, but could only last up to several seconds in the rat model, most likely due to escape of the particles between the applied pulses using our current experimental setting. In a pig model with open chest, MEF-based pacing was induced by banging magnetic particles and has lasted for a longer time. Due to overheating of the electromagnet, we intentionally terminated the experiments after 2 min. Our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of external leadless temporary pacing, using injectable magnetic microparticles that are manipulated by an external electromagnet. This new approach can have important utilities in clinical settings in which immediate and painless control of cardiac rhythm is required.","authors":"Menahem Y.

The relative composition of amorphous, α-form, and α’-form phases of PLA and its composites filled with halloysite nanotubes during heating was successfully obtained. It was found that only 47–56% of α’-form crystals transform into α-form crystals during a 2 °C/min heating process for PLA with a molecular weight of 54,300 g/mol. The loading of halloysite nanotubes decreases the cold crystallization and starting transition (α’ crystals transform into α-form crystals) temperatures of PLA. The crystallinity and the main diffraction peak intensity as a function of temperature were also analyzed. These results suggest that the α’-to-α form transition is a solid-solid phase transition.

{"abstract":" Mucor irregularis is an emerging fungal pathogen that cause cutaneous infection and could cause death. However, little is known about its mechanism of pathogenesis. There is evidence suggesting virulence vary with mating types in fungi, including the Mucorales. Here, we characterized the mating type locus of M. irregularis and the mating type ratio of 17 clinical isolates in China. Genomic data indicated M. irregularis is heterothallic having two mating types – bearing either SexP or SexM allele. Also, we employed a mice model to study the inflammation and pathological effects of different mating types. The comparison of the inflammatory response, cytokine profiles and Th-1, Th-2 and Th-17 cells numbers in each mating type treated mice showed that the severity and disease progress were enhanced in (+) mating type treated mice. One (+/0) mutant strain, with multiple mutations at the mating locus, had defects in sexual mating ability but appeared to be more virulent than the (−) mating type. Although (+) mating type appeared to be more virulent, most of our clinical isolates presented belonged to (−) mating type. Our findings support the involvement of MAT genes in sexual fertility, and the influence of mating type on the severity of cutaneous infection.","authors":"Wenqi Xu; Guanzhao Liang; Jingwen Peng; Zhimin Long; Dongmei Li; Meihua Fu; Qiong Wang; Yongnian Shen; Guixia Lv; Huan Mei; Clement K.

{"abstract":"Viruses are ubiquitous parasites of cellular life and the most abundant biological entities on Earth. It is widely accepted that viruses are polyphyletic, but a consensus scenario for their ultimate origin is still lacking. Traditionally, three scenarios for the origin of viruses have been considered: descent from primordial, precellular genetic elements, reductive evolution from cellular ancestors and escape of genes from cellular hosts, achieving partial replicative autonomy and becoming parasitic genetic elements. These classical scenarios give different timelines for the origin(s) of viruses and do not explain the provenance of the two key functional modules that are responsible, respectively, for viral genome replication and virion morphogenesis. Here, we outline a ‘chimeric’ scenario under which different types of primordial, selfish replicons gave rise to viruses by recruiting host proteins for virion formation. We also propose that new groups of viruses have repeatedly emerged at all stages of the evolution of life, often through the displacement of ancestral structural and genome replication genes. The origin of viruses is an unsolved, controversial question. In this Opinion article, Krupovic, Dolja and Koonin propose a new scenario for the origin of viruses based on primordial, selfish replicators acquiring structural proteins from cells, enabling them to form virions.","authors":"Mart Krupovic; Valerian V.

{"abstract":"Artificial neural networks are computational network models inspired by signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved performance for many machine-learning tasks, including speech and image recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made towards developing electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that exhibit improved computational speed and accuracy. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully optical neural network that, in principle, could offer an enhancement in computational speed and power efficiency over state-of-the-art electronics for conventional inference tasks. We experimentally demonstrate the essential part of the concept using a programmable nanophotonic processor featuring a cascaded array of 56 programmable Mach–Zehnder interferometers in a silicon photonic integrated circuit and show its utility for vowel recognition. Programmable silicon nanophotonic processor empowers optical neural networks.","authors":"Yichen Shen; Nicholas C.

{"abstract":"Fluorescence imaging in near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb, 1500–1700 nm) spectrum holds a great promise for tissue imaging. While few inorganic NIR-IIb fluorescent probes have been reported, their organic counterparts are still rarely developed, possibly due to the shortage of efficient materials with long emission wavelength. Herein, we propose a molecular design philosophy to explore pure organic NIR-IIb fluorophores by manipulation of the effects of twisted intramolecular charge transfer and aggregation-induced emission at the molecular and morphological levels. An organic fluorescent dye emitting up to 1600 nm with a quantum yield of 11.5% in the NIR-II region is developed. NIR-IIb fluorescence imaging of blood vessels and deeply-located intestinal tract of live mice based on organic dyes is achieved with high clarity and enhanced signal-to-background ratio. We hope this study will inspire further development on the evolution of pure organic NIR-IIb dyes for bio-imaging. Light has limited penetration depth in vivo which has led to increasing interest in NIR-II fluorophores.

The chemical compositions of PBO fibers before and after modification were analyzed by XPS and surface morphologies were observed by SEM. The hydrophobicity of PBO fibers was evaluated by the measurement of contact angle for water and the UV aging resistance was evaluated by the tensile strength retention ratio of PBO fibers. The results showed that KH-560 was successfully introduced onto the PBO fiber surface. The contact angle for water was increased by 128% from 51.7° to 127°, suggesting a huge improvement of hydrophobicity. The UV aging resistance of PBO fibers was also greatly improved. After 400 h UV exposure, the tensile strength retention ratio was increased to 53%, which was much higher than that of 21.4% for pristine PBO fibers.

{"abstract":"Signals arising from bacterial infections are detected by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) and are transduced by specialized adapter proteins in mammalian cells. The Receptor-interacting-serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2 or RIP2) is such an adapter protein that is critical for signal propagation of the Nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-containing proteins 1/2 (NOD1 and NOD2). Dysregulation of this signaling pathway leads to defects in bacterial detection and in some cases autoimmune diseases. Here, we show that the Caspase-activation-and-recruitment-domain (CARD) of RIP2 (RIP2-CARD) forms oligomeric structures upon stimulation by either NOD1-CARD or NOD2-2CARD. We reconstitute this complex, termed the RIPosome in vitro and solve the cryo-EM filament structure of the active RIP2-CARD complex at 4.1 Å resolution. The structure suggests potential mechanisms by which CARD domains from NOD1 and NOD2 initiate the oligomerization process of RIP2-CARD. Together with structure guided mutagenesis experiments at the CARD-CARD interfaces, we demonstrate molecular mechanisms how RIP2 is activated and self-propagating such signal. The pathogen recognition receptors NOD1/2 recognize bacterial cell wall components and signal through their downstream adapter kinase RIP2 via a CARD (Caspase activation and recruitment domain) mediated oligomerization process. Here the authors present the cryo-EM structure of the active RIP2-CARD filament and discuss implications for NOD1/2-RIP2 signalling.","authors":"Qin Gong; Ziqi Long; Franklin L.

However, no one method is appropriate to address all biological questions, as each variant differs markedly in resolution, reproducibility, throughput and biases. A thorough appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of each technique is critical when choosing the correct method for a specific application or for gauging how best to interpret different sources of data.

{"abstract":"Anaesthetics used during cancer surgery may influence tumour cells and immunological response. The aim of this study was to evaluate a potential influence of the anaesthetic method (inhaled anaesthetics versus total-intravenous anaesthesia using propofol) on recurrence-free and overall survival in glioblastoma patients. We retrospectively identified patients undergoing resection of contrast enhancing glioblastoma under general anaesthesia followed by standard adjuvant treatment between January 2010 and February 2017 at two University Hospitals. Matched pairs of patients receiving either balanced with volatile anaesthetics or total intravenous anaesthesia were generated according to the known prognostic factors (extent of resection, methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, age, Karnofsky performance score). Groups were compared using chi-square and Whitney-Man-U test. Time to recurrence was calculated using Kaplan Meier estimates. Log Rank test was used to assess the influence of the anaesthetic method. One hundred and fifty-eight (79:79) patients were included. Groups showed no significant difference in recurrence-free (volatiles: 8.0 (95% CI 6.5–9.8) vs. propofol: 8.4 (95% CI 7.9–10.1) months; p = 0.54) or overall survival (propofol: 17.4 (95% CI 14.0–20.7) vs. volatiles: 16.9 (95% CI 13.9–20.1) months; p = 0.85). In contrast to potential beneficial effects in some other solid tumours, the choice of anaesthetic method had no impact on survival in patients with glioblastoma in a well-defined cohort.","authors":"Stefan J.

{"abstract":"Autophagy is stimulated by exercise in several tissues; yet the role of skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific autophagy on the benefits of exercise training remains incompletely understood. Here, we determined the metabolic impact of exercise training in obese mice with cardiac and skeletal muscle disruption of the Autophagy related 7 gene (Atg7h\u0026mKO). Muscle autophagy deficiency did not affect glucose clearance and exercise capacity in lean adult mice. High-fat diet in sedentary mice led to endoplasmic reticulum stress and aberrant mitochondrial protein expression in autophagy-deficient skeletal and cardiac muscles. Endurance exercise training partially reversed these abnormalities in skeletal muscle, but aggravated those in the heart also causing cardiac fibrosis, foetal gene reprogramming, and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, exercise-trained Atg7h\u0026mKO mice were better protected against obesity and insulin resistance with increased circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), elevated Fgf21 mRNA and protein solely in the heart, and upregulation of FGF21-target genes involved in thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in brown fat. These results indicate that autophagy is essential for the protective effects of exercise in the heart. However, the atypical remodelling elicited by exercise in the autophagy deficient cardiac muscle enhances whole-body metabolism, at least partially, via a heart-brown fat cross-talk involving FGF21.","authors":"Zhen Yan; Ana Kronemberger; Jay Blomme; Jarrod A.

{"abstract":"Ionic gating is known as a powerful tool for investigation of electronic functionalities stemming from low voltage transistor operation to gate-induced electronic phase control including superconductivity. Two-dimensional (2D) material is one of the archetypal channel materials which exhibit a variety of gate-induced phenomena. Nevertheless, the device simulations on such ion-gated transistor devices have never been reported, despite its importance for the future design of device structures. In this paper, we developed a drift-diffusion (DD) model on a 2D material, WSe2 monolayer, attached with an ionic liquid, and succeeded in simulating the transport properties, potential profile, carrier density distributions in the transistor configuration. In particular, the simulation explains the ambipolar behavior with the gate voltage comparable to the band gap energy, as well as the formation of p-n junctions in the channel reported in several experimental papers. Such peculiar behavior becomes possible by the dramatic change of the potential profiles at the Schottky barrier by the ionic gating. The present result indicates that the DD model coupled to the Poisson equation is a fascinating platform to explain and predict further functionalities of ion-gated transistors through including the spin, valley, and optical degrees of freedom.","authors":"Akiko Ueda; Yijin Zhang; Nobuyuki Sano; Hiroshi Imamura; Yoshihiro Iwasa","keywords":"Electrical and electronic engineering; Electronic devices","organization_affiliated":"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Spintronics Research Center, Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, USA; The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart, Germany; Institute of Applied Physics, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Spintronics Research Center, Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Applied Physics and Quantum-Phase Electronics (QPEC) Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; RIKEN, Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, Japan","title":"Ambipolar device simulation based on the drift-diffusion model in ion-gated transition metal dichalcogenide transistors","id":"0d6211c3-f52e-4515-a753-5f33c49b3eec"}
{"abstract":"Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have recently been proposed as an excitonic platform for advanced optical and electronic functionalities1–3. However, in spite of intense research efforts, it has not been widely appreciated that TMDCs also possess a high refractive index4,5. This characteristic opens up the possibility to utilize them to construct resonant nanoantennas based on subwavelength geometrical modes6,7. Here, we show that nanodisks, fabricated from exfoliated multilayer WS2, support distinct Mie resonances and anapole states8 that can be tuned in wavelength over the visible and near-infrared range by varying the nanodisk size and aspect ratio. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a novel regime of light–matter interaction—anapole-exciton polaritons—which we realize within a single WS2 nanodisk. We argue that the TMDC material anisotropy and the presence of excitons enrich traditional nanophotonics approaches based on conventional high-index materials and/or plasmonics. In individual tungsten diselenide nanodisks, excitonic and anapole modes can strongly couple to form a polariton.","authors":"Ruggero Verre; Denis G.

{"abstract":"Wettability is the affinity of a liquid for a solid surface. For energetic reasons, macroscopic drops of liquid form nearly spherical caps. The degree of wettability is then captured by the contact angle where the liquid-vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. As droplet volumes shrink to the scale of attoliters, however, surface interactions become significant, and droplets assume distorted shapes. In this regime, the contact angle becomes ambiguous, and a scalable metric for quantifying wettability is needed, especially given the emergence of technologies exploiting liquid-solid interactions at the nanoscale. Here we combine nanoscale experiments with molecular-level simulation to study the breakdown of spherical droplet shapes at small length scales. We demonstrate how measured droplet topographies increasingly reveal non-spherical features as volumes shrink. Ultimately, the nanoscale droplets flatten out to form layer-like molecular assemblies at the solid surface. For the lack of an identifiable contact angle at small scales, we introduce a droplet’s adsorption energy density as a new metric for a liquid’s affinity for a surface. We discover that extrapolating the macroscopic idealization of a drop to the nanoscale, though it does not geometrically resemble a realistic droplet, can nonetheless recover its adsorption energy if line tension is included.","authors":"Ronaldo Giro; Peter W.

{"abstract":"Dopamine (DA) release in striatum is functionally segregated across a dorsolateral/ventromedial axis. Interestingly, nigrostriatal DA signaling disruption in Parkinson’s disease (PD) preferentially affects the dorsolateral striatum. The relationship between afferent presynaptic calcium transients (PreCaTs) in DA terminals and DA release in dorsolateral (Caudato-Putamen, DLS) and ventromedial (Nucleus Accumbens Shell, VS) striatal subregions was examined by ex vivo real-time dual-recording in conditional transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator protein GCaMP3. In DLS, minimal increases in cytosolic calcium trigger steep DA release while PreCaTs and DA release in VS both were proportional to the number of pulses in burst stimulation. Co-expressing α-synuclein with the Parkinson’s disease (PD)-associated A53T mutation and GCaMP3 in midbrain DA neurons revealed augmented cytosolic steady state and activity-dependent intra-terminal calcium levels preferentially in DLS, as well as hyperactivation and enhanced expression of N-type calcium channels. Thus, unbalanced calcium channel activity is a presynaptic mechanism to consider in the multifaceted pathogenic pathways of progressive neurodegeneration.","authors":"Carmelo Sgobio; Lixin Sun; Jinhui Ding; Jochen Herms; David M.

{"abstract":"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinease-1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by hypotonic stimuli, which is involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Our previous study shows that activation of volume-regulated Cl− channels (VRCCs) protects rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether SGK1 was involved in the protective effect of VRCCs in BASMCs. We showed that hypotonic challenge significantly reduced H2O2-induced apoptosis, and increased SGK1 phosphorylation, but did not affect SGK1 protein expression. The protective effect of hypotonic challenge against H2O2-induced apoptosis was mediated through inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, evidenced by increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and inhibition of the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These protective effects of hypotonic challenge against H2O2-induced apoptosis was diminished and enhanced, respectively, by SGK1 knockdown and overexpression. We further revealed that SGK1 activation significantly increased forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) phosphorylation, and then inhibited the translocation of FOXO3a into nucleus and the subsequent expression of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). In conclusion, SGK1 mediates the protective effect of VRCCs against H2O2-induced apoptosis in BASMCs via inhibiting FOXO3a/Bim signaling pathway. Our results provide compelling evidences that SGK1 is a critical link between VRCCs and apoptosis, and shed a new light on the treatment of vascular apoptosis-associated diseases, such as vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and atherosclerosis.","authors":"Bao-yi Chen; Cheng-cui Huang; Xiao-fei Lv; Hua-qing Zheng; Ya-juan Zhang; Lu Sun; Guan-lei Wang; Ming-ming Ma; Yong-yuan Guan","keywords":"Biomedicine, general; Pharmacology/Toxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; The Central Laboratory, Shenzhen Second People’s Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pharmacology, and Cardiac \u0026 Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China","title":"SGK1 mediates the hypotonic protective effect against H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis of rat basilar artery smooth muscle cells by inhibiting the FOXO3a/Bim signaling pathway","id":"a84a1776-c015-4dd9-8813-4322bd4c1680"}

{"abstract":"Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest events since the Big Bang itself, are believed to originate in an ultra-relativistic jet breaking out from a massive stellar envelope. Despite decades of study, there is still no consensus on their emission mechanism. One unresolved question is the origin of the tight correlation between the spectral peak energy and peak luminosity discovered in observations. This Yonetoku relation is the tightest correlation found in the properties of the prompt phase of GRB emission, providing the best diagnostic for the radiation mechanism. Here we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, and post-process radiation transfer calculations, of photospheric emission from a relativistic jet. Our simulations reproduce the Yonetoku relation as a natural consequence of viewing angle. Although jet dynamics depend sensitively on luminosity, the correlation holds regardless. This result strongly suggests that photospheric emission is the dominant component in the prompt phase of GRBs. Yonetoku relation provides a diagnostic for the radiation mechanism in the prompt phase of gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission. Here, Ito et al. show the reproduction of this relation in 3D hydrodynamical simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations, which suggest the photospheric emission is the dominant component in the prompt phase of GRBs.","authors":"Hirotaka Ito; Jin Matsumoto; Shigehiro Nagataki; Donald C.

{"abstract":"Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCCA) is the most common type of cholangiocarcinoma with low resection rate and high morbidity. The study of PHCCA biomarkers made progresses slowly compared with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma because of surgical complexity and low possibility of radical surgery, which resulted in the difficulty of specimen obtainment. To screen and identify new biomarkers in PHCCA, we constructed a retrospective cohort with 121 PHCCA patients and a prospective cohort consisting of 64 PHCCA patients, and screened the candidate biomarkers by immunohistochemistry and quantified PCR. In our study, expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was demonstrated to be significantly associated with microvascular density (MVD) and unfavorable prognosis of PHCCA in both retrospective and prospective study. Moreover, HMGB1 concentrations in bile and serum of PHCCA patients and healthy controls were detected and compared. Postoperative serum HMGB1 and reflux cholangitis indicated recurrence and unfavorable prognosis of PHCCA. With experiments in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that intracellular HMGB1 could be released from PHCCA cells and induce invasion and angiogenesis with LPS stimulation. VEGFR2 expression in vessel endothelial cells was upregulated by the released HMGB1 from PHCCA, resulting in the ectopic angiogenesis. In conclusion, intracellular HMGB1 could be released from PHCCA cells and promote angiogenesis via elevating VEGFR2 in vessel endothelial cells. High expression of HMGB1 was associated with MVD and poor prognosis in clinical analyzation. Postoperative serum HMGB1 and cholangitis could predict high recurrence and unfavorable prognosis.","authors":"Yun-Fei Xu; Zeng-Li Liu; Chang Pan; Xiao-Qing Yang; Shang-Lei Ning; Hong-Da Liu; Sen Guo; Jin-Ming Yu; Zong-Li Zhang","keywords":"Cancer; Prognostic markers","organization_affiliated":"Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of Emergency Medicine and Chest Pain Center, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of Pathology, Qianfoshan Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of Pharmacology \u0026 Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA; Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of Radiation Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China; Department of General Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China","title":"HMGB1 correlates with angiogenesis and poor prognosis of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma via elevating VEGFR2 of vessel endothelium","id":"02e59824-ee3f-485a-87f4-1b0e9d288429"}

{"abstract":"Gliomas are the most prevalent primary brain tumors with immense clinical heterogeneity, poor prognosis and survival. The nucleotide-binding domain, and leucine-rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) and absent-in-melanoma 2 (AIM2) are innate immune receptors crucial for initiation and progression of several cancers. There is a dearth of reports linking NLRs and AIM2 to glioma pathology. NLRs are expressed by cells of innate immunity, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils, as well as cells of the adaptive immune system. NLRs are critical regulators of major inflammation, cell death, immune and cancer-associated pathways. We used a data-driven approach to identify NLRs, AIM2 and NLR-associated gene expression and methylation patterns in low grade glioma and glioblastoma, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient datasets. Since TCGA data is obtained from tumor tissue, comprising of multiple cell populations including glioma cells, endothelial cells and tumor-associated microglia/macrophages we have used multiple cell lines and human brain tissues to identify cell-specific effects. TCGA data mining showed significant differential NLR regulation and strong correlation with survival in different grades of glioma. We report differential expression and methylation of NLRs in glioma, followed by NLRP12 identification as a candidate prognostic marker for glioma progression. We found that Nlrp12 deficient microglia show increased colony formation while Nlrp12 deficient glioma cells show decreased cellular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry of human glioma tissue shows increased NLRP12 expression. Interestingly, microglia show reduced migration towards Nlrp12 deficient glioma cells.","authors":"Nidhi Sharma; Shivanjali Saxena; Ishan Agrawal; Shalini Singh; Varsha Srinivasan; S.

{"abstract":"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a significant complication of cytotoxic treatments due to extreme ovarian sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation. POI is particularly devastating for young girls reaching puberty, because it irreversibly affects their physical and cognitive development. Changes occurring during puberty determine their height, bone health, insulin responsiveness, lipid metabolism, cardiovascular health and cognition. The only available treatment for POI during puberty is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which delivers non-physiological levels of estrogen, lacks other ovarian hormones and pulsatility, and is not responsive to feedback regulation. Here we report that ovarian allografts encapsulated in a hydrogel-based capsule and implanted in ovariectomized mice restore ovarian endocrine function in immune competent mice. Ovarian tissue from BALB/c mice was encapsulated in poly(ethylene-glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, with a proteolytically degradable core and a non-degradable shell. The dual capsules were implanted subcutaneously in immune competent ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice for a period of 60 days. As expected, non-encapsulated ovarian allografts implanted in a control group sensitized the recipients as confirmed with donor-specific IgG in the serum, which increased 26-fold in the 3 weeks following transplantation (p = 0.02) and infiltration of the graft with CD8 T cells consistent with allo-immunity. In contrast, encapsulation in the Dual PEG capsules prevented sensitization to the allograft in all the recipients with no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration. In summary, the approach of hydrogel-based immunoisolation presents a minimally invasive and robust cell-therapy to restore hormonal balance in ovarian insufficiency. This report is the first to demonstrate the application of a tunable PEG-based hydrogel as an immunoisolator of allogeneic ovarian tissue to restore endocrine function in ovariectomized mice and prevent cell-mediated immune rejection in immune competent mice.","authors":"James Ronald Day; Anu David; Mayara Garcia de Mattos Barbosa; Margaret Ann Brunette; Marilia Cascalho; Ariella Shikanov","keywords":"Biomedical engineering; Endocrine reproductive disorders; Immunology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Microbiology \u0026 Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Microbiology \u0026 Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Macromolecular Science \u0026 Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","title":"Encapsulation of ovarian allograft precludes immune rejection and promotes restoration of endocrine function in immune-competent ovariectomized mice","id":"8e2ac9ba-615b-4557-ac76-51ddeb56c5d3"}
{"abstract":"Volcanic hotspot islands are thought to be surface manifestations of mantle plumes that rise from the core–mantle boundary. When mantle plumes approach the surface, their mostly vertical rise must be deflected into near-horizontal flow beneath tectonic plates. This creates an opportunity to constrain their dynamics and their interactions with lithospheric plates and mid-ocean ridges. Seafloor observations have been used to propose that a focused flow in the asthenosphere transports plume heat to the nearest mid-ocean ridge, where it efficiently dissipates through formation of lithosphere. Here we present imaging results from a seismological survey of a proposed plume-to-ridge flow channel between the Réunion hotspot and the Central Indian Ridge. Rayleigh-wave tomography and shear-wave splitting confirm the presence of a channelized flow of shallow asthenosphere, eastward from the hotspot to the spreading ridge. At a larger scale, a deeper reservoir of hot asthenosphere fills vast tracts of the Indian Ocean basin east and north of Réunion Island. Its flows, decoupled from overlying lithospheres, are also directed towards the Central Indian Ridge but extend well beyond, tapped but not significantly depleted by the spreading ridge. Based on seismic and geochemical observations, we suggest that this hidden heat reservoir is generated and driven by the mantle plume, which buffers more heat near the surface than expected. A large, deep reservoir of asthenosphere flows eastward from the Réunion hotspot and interacts with the Indian spreading ridge, suggests seismological imaging.","authors":"G. Barruol; K.

{"abstract":"Most supercooled non-polymeric glass-forming melts exhibit a shear thinning phenomenon, i.e., viscosity decreases with increasing the strain rate. On compressing borosilicate glasses at high temperature, however, we discovered an interesting oscillatory viscous flow and identified it as a typical relaxation oscillation caused by the peculiar structure of borosilicate glass. Specifically, the micro-structure of borosilicate glass can be divided into borate network and silicate network. Under loading, deformation is mainly localized in the borate network via a transformation from the three coordinated planar boron to trigonal boron that could serve as a precursor for the subsequent formation of a BO4 tetrahedron, while the surrounding silicate network is acting as a stabilization/relaxation agent. The formation of stress oscillation was further described and explained by a new physics-based constitutive model.","authors":"W. D. Liu; L. C. Zhang; K.

{"abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) response to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) may be influenced by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). This study aimed to assess if NS5A baseline RAS-guided treatment enhances the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) in naïve HCV-infected patients in clinical practice. All HCV-infected patients who initiated treatment with interferon (IFN)-free DAA-based regimens between March 2016 and May 2017 in 17 Spanish hospitals and who had evaluable SVR 12 weeks (SVR12) after the end of therapy were included. Patients had to be DAA naïve, with the exception of sofosbuvir with/without IFN. In one hospital, participants received therapy guided by the presence of NS5A-RASs (RGT population). Patients enrolled in the remaining hospitals, without baseline RASs testing, constituted the control population. A total of 120 and 512 patients were included in the RGT and control populations, respectively. Nine (7.5%) individuals in the RGT population showed baseline NS5A-RASs. All of them achieved SVR12. The SVR12 rate in the RGT population was 97.2% (three relapses) whereas it was 98.8% (six relapses) in the control population (p = 0.382). Our findings suggest that testing for baseline NS5A-RASs in naïve HCV-infected patients does not enhance the rate of SVR to DAA-based IFN-free therapy in clinical practice.","authors":"Luis M.

{"abstract":"The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic signalling through the sodium- and chloride-dependent reuptake of neurotransmitter into presynaptic neurons. SERT is a target for antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs, which block reuptake and prolong neurotransmitter signalling. Here we report X-ray crystallographic structures of human SERT at 3.15 Å resolution bound to the antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine. Antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding. We further identify the location of an allosteric site in the complex as residing at the periphery of the extracellular vestibule, interposed between extracellular loops 4 and 6 and transmembrane helices 1, 6, 10 and 11. Occupancy of the allosteric site sterically hinders ligand unbinding from the central site, providing an explanation for the action of (S)-citalopram as an allosteric ligand. These structures define the mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT, and provide blueprints for future drug design. X-ray crystal structures of the human serotonin transporter (SERT) bound to the antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine show that the antidepressants lock the protein in an outward-open conformation, and directly block serotonin from entering its binding site; the structures define the mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT and pave the way for future drug design. Serotonin modulates the activity of the central nervous system, as well as many other processes throughout the body. These authors have solved X-ray structures of the human serotonin transporter (SERT) in complex with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (S)-citalopram and paroxetine — two of the most widely prescribed antidepressants. The resulting structures reveal that the antidepressants lock the protein in an outward-open conformation, and directly block the entry of serotonin into its binding site. A previously unknown allosteric site is seen in the extracellular vestibule; binding of ligands to this site prevents dissociation from the central site, establishing a mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT and pointing the way for future drug design.","authors":"Jonathan A.

{"abstract":"SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) is a transcription factor regulating both chondrogenesis and sex determination. Among vertebrates, SOX9’s functions in chondrogenesis are well conserved, while they vary in sex determination. To investigate the conservation of SOX9’s regulatory functions in chondrogenesis and gonad development among species, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) using developing limb buds and male gonads from embryos of two vertebrates, mouse and chicken. In both mouse and chicken, SOX9 bound to intronic and distal regions of genes more frequently in limb buds than in male gonads, while SOX9 bound to the proximal upstream regions of genes more frequently in male gonads than in limb buds. In both species, SOX palindromic repeats were identified more frequently in SOX9 binding regions in limb bud genes compared with those in male gonad genes. The conservation of SOX9 binding regions was significantly higher in limb bud genes. In addition, we combined RNA expression analysis (RNA sequencing) with the ChIP-seq results at the same stage in developing chondrocytes and Sertoli cells and determined SOX9 target genes in these cells of the two species and disclosed that SOX9 targets showed high similarity of targets in chondrocytes, but not in Sertoli cells.","authors":"Satoshi Yamashita; Kensuke Kataoka; Hiroto Yamamoto; Tomoko Kato; Satoshi Hara; Katsushi Yamaguchi; Claire Renard-Guillet; Yuki Katou; Katsuhiko Shirahige; Haruki Ochi; Hajime Ogino; Tokujiro Uchida; Masafumi Inui; Shuji Takada; Shuji Shigenobu; Hiroshi Asahara","keywords":"Gene regulation; Transcription","organization_affiliated":"Department of Systems BioMedicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Research Fellow of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Anesthesiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Japan; Functional Genomics Facility, National Institute for Basic Biology, 38, Nishigonaka Myodaiji, Okazaki, Japan; Laboratory of Genome Structure and Function Center for Epigenetic Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Laboratory of Genome Structure and Function Center for Epigenetic Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Laboratory of Genome Structure and Function Center for Epigenetic Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Institute for Promotion of Medical Science Research, Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan; Amphibian Research Center, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan; Department of Anesthesiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Japan; Laboratory of Animal Regeneration Systemology, Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Japan; Functional Genomics Facility, National Institute for Basic Biology, 38, Nishigonaka Myodaiji, Okazaki, Japan; Department of Systems BioMedicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, California, USA; AMED-CREST, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), Tokyo, Japan","title":"Comparative analysis demonstrates cell type-specific conservation of SOX9 targets between mouse and chicken","id":"33db468a-3015-4687-b596-4d907f8a5caa"}

{"abstract":"Wolff’s law and the Utah Paradigm of skeletal physiology state that bone architecture adapts to mechanical loads. These models predict the existence of a mechanostat that links strain induced by mechanical forces to skeletal remodeling. However, how the mechanostat influences bone remodeling remains elusive. Here, we find that Piezo1 deficiency in osteoblastic cells leads to loss of bone mass and spontaneous fractures with increased bone resorption. Furthermore, Piezo1-deficient mice are resistant to further bone loss and bone resorption induced by hind limb unloading, demonstrating that PIEZO1 can affect osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk in response to mechanical forces. At the mechanistic level, in response to mechanical loads, PIEZO1 in osteoblastic cells controls the YAP-dependent expression of type II and IX collagens. In turn, these collagen isoforms regulate osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data identify PIEZO1 as the major skeletal mechanosensor that tunes bone homeostasis. Mechanical forces induce bone remodeling, but how bone cells sense mechanical signaling is unclear. Here, the authors show that loss of the mechanotransduction channel Piezo1 in osteoblastic cells impairs osteoclast activity via YAP signaling and collagen expression, leading to reduced bone mass and spontaneous fractures.","authors":"Lijun Wang; Xiuling You; Sutada Lotinun; Lingli Zhang; Nan Wu; Weiguo Zou","keywords":"Bone quality and biomechanics; Bone remodelling","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Department of Physiology and Skeletal Disorders Research Unit, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Institute of Microsurgery on Extremities, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, Shanghai, China","title":"Mechanical sensing protein PIEZO1 regulates bone homeostasis via osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk","id":"a53f64d4-9f43-41f7-84e9-101f07e227d8"}
{"abstract":"Cohesin is a regulator of genome architecture with roles in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome compaction. The recruitment and mobility of cohesin complexes on DNA is restricted by nucleosomes. Here, we show that the role of cohesin in chromosome organization requires the histone chaperone FACT (‘facilitates chromatin transcription’) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that FACT interacts directly with cohesin, and is dynamically required for its localization on chromatin. Depletion of FACT in metaphase cells prevents cohesin accumulation at pericentric regions and causes reduced binding on chromosome arms. Using the Hi-C technique, we show that cohesin-dependent TAD (topological associated domain)-like structures in G1 and metaphase chromosomes are reduced in the absence of FACT. Sister chromatid cohesion is intact in FACT-depleted cells, although chromosome segregation failure is observed. Our data show that FACT contributes to the formation of cohesin-dependent TADs, thus uncovering a new role for this complex in nuclear organization during interphase and mitotic chromosome folding. The histone chaperone FACT interacts directly with cohesin and contributes to the functions of cohesin in nuclear organization during interphase and during mitotic chromosome folding in S. cerevisiae.","authors":"Jonay Garcia-Luis; Luciana Lazar-Stefanita; Pilar Gutierrez-Escribano; Agnes Thierry; Axel Cournac; Alicia García; Sara González; Mar Sánchez; Adam Jarmuz; Alex Montoya; Marian Dore; Holger Kramer; Mohammad M.

{"abstract":"The mechanism underlying tissue fusion mediated by laser irradiation remains unclear. We clarify the mechanisms underlying laser-mediated tissue fusion using a novel model. Microscopic examinations of morphological changes within the adventitia of a bovine carotid artery and a collagen sheet prepared from bovine dermis showed collagen fibril bundle loosening and collagen fibre swelling following heating at 46 °C. An incised bovine carotid artery covered with a collagen sheet to which pressure and laser heat of 40 °C–52 °C were applied created a structure that was pressure resistant to \u003e300 mmHg. Microscopic analyses of the irradiation site showed collagen fibril interdigitation. Hence, low-temperature laser-mediated tissue fusion causes collagen fibril bundles to loosen and swell, and crimping causes the fibres to intertwine. As the temperature declines, the loosened and swollen fibrils and fibres tighten, and collagen fibre interdigitation is completed. This technology could be applied to fuse tissues during surgery.","authors":"Shun Sasaki; Tetsuo Ikeda; Shin-ichiro Okihara; Shotaro Nishimura; Ryu Nakadate; Hiroshi Saeki; Eiji Oki; Masaki Mori; Makoto Hashizume; Yoshihiko Maehara","keywords":"Medical research; Tissues","organization_affiliated":"Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Endoscopy and Endoscopic Surgery, Fukuoka Dental College, Fukuoka, Japan; Graduate School for the Creation of the New Photonics Industries, Shizuoka, Japan; Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Surgery, Kyushu Central Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan","title":"Principles and development of collagen-mediated tissue fusion induced by laser irradiation","id":"d5192bc9-843a-4efc-b645-671a20f77caa"}
{"abstract":"Mobile and wearable device-captured data have the potential to inform Parkinson’s disease (PD) care. The objective of the Clinician Input Study was to assess the feasibility and clinical utility of data obtained using a mobile health technology from PD patients. In this observational, exploratory study, PD participants wore a smartwatch and used the Fox Wearable Companion mobile phone app to stream movement data and report symptom severity and medication intake for 6 months. Data were analyzed using the Intel® Pharma Analytics Platform. Clinicians reviewed participants’ data in a dashboard during in-office visits at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Clinicians provided feedback in focus groups leading to dashboard updates. Between June and August 2017, 51 PD patients were recruited at four US sites, and 39 (76%) completed the 6-month study. Patients streamed 83,432 h of movement data from their smartwatches (91% of expected). Reporting of symptoms and medication intake using the app was lower than expected, 44% and 60%, respectively, but did not differ according to baseline characteristics. Clinicians’ feedback resulted in ten updates to the dashboard during the study period. Clinicians reported that medications and patient reported outcomes were generally discernable in the dashboard and complementary to clinical assessments. Movement, symptoms, and medication intake data were feasibly translated from the app into a clinician dashboard but there was substantial attrition rate over 6 months. Further enhancements are needed to ensure long-term patient adherence to portable technologies and optimal digital data transfer to clinicians caring for PD patients.","authors":"Jordan J.

{"abstract":"Evolutionally conserved Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch morphogen pathways play essential roles in the development, homeostasis and pathogenesis of multicellular organisms. Nevertheless, mechanisms that intracellularly coordinate these signal inputs remain poorly understood. Here we found that parafibromin, a component of the PAF complex, competitively interacts with β-catenin and Gli1, thereby potentiating transactivation of Wnt- and Hh-target genes in a mutually exclusive manner. Parafibromin also binds to the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), enabling concerted activation of Wnt- and Notch-target genes. The transcriptional platform function of parafibromin is potentiated by tyrosine dephosphorylation, mediated by SHP2 phosphatase, while it is attenuated by tyrosine phosphorylation, mediated by PTK6 kinase. Consequently, acute loss of parafibromin in mice disorganizes the normal epithelial architecture of the intestine, which requires coordinated activation/inactivation of Wnt, Hh and/or Notch signalling. Parafibromin integrates and converts signals conveyed by these morphogen pathways into appropriate transcriptional outputs in a tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-regulated manner. Normal epithelial intestine organisation requires Wnt and Hedgehog signalling activity. Here, the authors show that parafibromin can activate both pathways in a mutually exclusive manner and is important for intestinal homeostasis.

{"abstract":"In isolated or declining populations, viability may be compromised further by loss of genetic diversity. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between long-term ecological trajectories and population genetic structure. However, opportunities to combine these types of data are rare, especially in natural systems. Using an existing panel of 15 microsatellites, we estimated allelic diversity in seagrass, Zostera marina, at five sites around the Isles of Scilly Special Area of Conservation, UK, in 2010 and compared this to 23 years of annual ecological monitoring (1996–2018). We found low diversity and long-term declines in abundance in this relatively pristine but isolated location. Inclusion of the snapshot of genotypic, but less-so genetic, diversity improved prediction of abundance trajectories; however, this was spatial scale-dependent. Selection of the appropriate level of genetic organization and spatial scale for monitoring is, therefore, important to identify drivers of eco-evolutionary dynamics. This has implications for the use of population genetic information in conservation, management, and spatial planning.","authors":"Nahaa M. Alotaibi; Emma J. Kenyon; Kevan J.

{"abstract":"Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a nonselective cation channel, is the predominant mammalian cold temperature thermosensor and it is activated by cold temperatures and cooling compounds, such as menthol and icilin. Because of its role in cold allodynia, cold hyperalgesia and painful syndromes TRPM8 antagonists are currently being pursued as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of pain hypersensitivity. Recently TRPM8 has been found in subsets of bladder sensory nerve fibres, providing an opportunity to understand and treat chronic hypersensitivity. However, most of the known TRPM8 inhibitors lack selectivity, and only three selective compounds have reached clinical trials to date. Here, we applied two virtual screening strategies to find new, clinics suitable, TRPM8 inhibitors. This strategy enabled us to identify naphthyl derivatives as a novel class of potent and selective TRPM8 inhibitors. Further characterization of the pharmacologic properties of the most potent compound identified, compound 1, confirmed that it is a selective, competitive antagonist inhibitor of TRPM8. Compound 1 also proved itself active in a overreactive bladder model in vivo. Thus, the novel naphthyl derivative compound identified here could be optimized for clinical treatment of pain hypersensitivity in bladder disorders but also in different other pathologies.","authors":"Andrea R.

{"abstract":"Cellular homoeostatic pathways such as macroautophagy (hereinafter autophagy) are regulated by basic mechanisms that are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. However, it remains poorly understood how these mechanisms further evolved in higher organisms. Here we describe a modification in the autophagy pathway in vertebrates, which promotes its activity in response to oxidative stress. We have identified two oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues in a prototypic autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62, which allow activation of pro-survival autophagy in stress conditions. The Drosophila p62 homologue, Ref(2)P, lacks these oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues and their introduction into the protein increases protein turnover and stress resistance of flies, whereas perturbation of p62 oxidation in humans may result in age-related pathology. We propose that the redox-sensitivity of p62 may have evolved in vertebrates as a mechanism that allows activation of autophagy in response to oxidative stress to maintain cellular homoeostasis and increase cell survival. The cellular mechanisms underlying autophagy are conserved; however it is unclear how they evolved in higher organisms. Here the authors identify two oxidation-sensitive cysteine residues in the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 in vertebrates which allow activation of pro-survival autophagy in stress conditions.","authors":"Bernadette Carroll; Elsje G.

{"abstract":"Inferring the locomotor behaviour of the last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and African apes is still a divisive issue. An African great-ape-like ancestor using knuckle-walking is still the most parsimonious hypothesis for the LCA, despite diverse conflicting lines of evidence. Crucial to this hypothesis is the role of the centrale in the hominoid wrist, since the fusion of this bone with the scaphoid is among the clearest morphological synapomorphies of African apes and hominins. However, the exact functional significance of this fusion remains unclear. We address this question by carrying out finite element simulations of the hominoid wrist during knuckle-walking by virtually generating fused and unfused morphologies in a sample of hominoids. Finite element analysis was applied to test the hypothesis that a fused scaphoid-centrale better withstands the loads derived from knuckle-walking. The results show that fused morphologies display lower stress values, hence supporting a biomechanical explanation for the fusion as a functional adaptation for knuckle-walking. This functional interpretation for the fusion contrasts with the current inferred positional behaviour of the earliest hominins, thus suggesting that this morphology was probably retained from an LCA that exhibited knuckle-walking as part of its locomotor repertoire and that was probably later exapted for other functions.","authors":"Thomas A.

{"abstract":"Limited regeneration after nerve injury often leads to delayed or incomplete reinnervation and consequently insufficient muscle function. Following nerve surgery, application of low-intensity ultrasound or extracorporeal shock waves may promote nerve regeneration and improve functional outcomes. Because currently clinical data is unavailable, we performed a meta-analysis following the PRISMA-guidelines to investigate the therapeutic effect of ultrasound and shock wave therapies on motor nerve regeneration. Ten ultrasound-studies (N = 445 rats) and three shock-wave studies (N = 110 rats) were identified from multiple databases. We calculated the difference in means or standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals for motor function, nerve conduction velocity and histomorphological parameters of treated versus sham or non-treated animals. Ultrasound treatment showed significantly faster nerve conduction, increased axonal regeneration with thicker myelin and improved motor function on sciatic functional index scale (week two: DM[95%CI]: 19,03[13,2 to 25,6], 71 animals; week four: 7,4[5,4 to 9,5], 47 animals). Shock wave induced recovery improvements were temporarily significant. In conclusion, there is significant evidence for low-intensity ultrasound but not for extracorporeal shock wave treatment to improve nerve regeneration. Prospective clinical trials should therefore investigate available FDA-approved ultrasound devices as adjunct postoperative treatment following nerve surgery.","authors":"Simeon C.

{"abstract":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Though recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk variants for MDD, how these variants confer MDD risk remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterize the regulatory mechanism of MDD risk variants using a functional genomics approach. By integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (from human brain tissues or neuronal cells) and position weight matrix (PWM) data, we identified 34 MDD risk SNPs that disrupt the binding of 15 transcription factors (TFs). We verified the regulatory effect of the TF binding–disrupting SNPs with reporter gene assays, allelic-specific expression analysis, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identified the target genes that might be regulated by these regulatory risk SNPs. Finally, we found that NEGR1 (regulated by the TF binding–disrupting MDD risk SNP rs3101339) was dysregulated in the brains of MDD cases compared with controls, implying that rs3101339 may confer MDD risk by affecting NEGR1 expression. Our findings reveal how genetic variants contribute to MDD risk by affecting TF binding and gene regulation. More importantly, our study identifies the potential MDD causal variants and their target genes, thus providing pivotal candidates for future mechanistic study and drug development.","authors":"Shiwu Li; Yifan Li; Xiaoyan Li; Jiewei Liu; Yongxia Huo; Junyang Wang; Zhongchun Liu; Ming Li; Xiong-Jian Luo","keywords":"Depression; Genetics","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences \u0026 Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; Center for Excellence in Animal Evolution and Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China; KIZ-CUHK Joint Laboratory of Bioresources and Molecular Research in Common Diseases, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China","title":"Regulatory mechanisms of major depressive disorder risk variants","id":"8a9cb408-b8f9-4e18-91a0-7a20236241b7"}
{"abstract":"In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE segmentation steps can be learned over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) or even a domain-specific dataset and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif discovery and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif discovery method and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in three different settings: (1) comparison of DiMotif with two existing approaches on 20 distinct motif discovery problems which are experimentally verified, (2) classification-based approach for the motifs extracted for integrins, integrin-binding proteins, and biofilm formation, and (3) in sequence pattern searching for nuclear localization signal. The DiMotif, in general, obtained high recall scores, while having a comparable F1 score with other methods in the discovery of experimentally verified motifs. Having high recall suggests that the DiMotif can be used for short-list creation for further experimental investigations on motifs. In the classification-based evaluation, the extracted motifs could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variablelength protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks. In addition, we conclude that the embeddings are beneficial in protein classification tasks when they are combined with raw amino acids k-mer features.","authors":"Ehsaneddin Asgari; Alice C.

{"abstract":"Liquid interfacial plasmonic platform is emerging for new sensors, catalysis, and tunable optical devices, but also promises an alternative for practical applications of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Here we show that vigorous mixing of chloroform with citrate-capped gold nanorod sols triggers the rapid self-assembly of three-dimensional plasmonic arrays at the chloroform/water (O/W) interface and produces a self-healing metal liquid-like brilliant golden droplet. The O phase itself generates stable SERS fingerprints and is a good homogeneous internal standard for quantitative analysis. This platform presents reversible O/W encasing in a common cuvette determined just by surface wettability of the container. Both O-in-W and W-in-O platforms exhibit excellent SERS sensitivity and reproducibility for different analytes by the use of a portable Raman device. It paves the way toward a practical and quantitative liquid-state SERS analyzer, likened to a simple UV–Vis spectrometer, that is far superior to typical solid substrate-based or nanoparticle sol-based analysis. The design and application of a liquid interfacial plasmonic platform promises for practical applications of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Here, the authors report a reversible chloroform/water encasing strategy to self-assemble metal liquid-like 3D gold nanorod arrays with attractive SERS capability.","authors":"Li Tian; Mengke Su; Fanfan Yu; Yue Xu; Xiaoyun Li; Lei Li; Honglin Liu; Weihong Tan","keywords":"Bioanalytical chemistry; Characterization and analytical techniques; Sensors","organization_affiliated":"College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; Molecular Science and Biomedicine Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Bio-Sensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Life Sciences, and Aptamer Engineering Center of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; College of Food Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; Molecular Science and Biomedicine Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Bio-Sensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Life Sciences, and Aptamer Engineering Center of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Molecular Science and Biomedicine Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Bio-Sensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Life Sciences, and Aptamer Engineering Center of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Department of Chemistry and Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, Health Cancer Center, UF Genetics Institute, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA","title":"Liquid-state quantitative SERS analyzer on self-ordered metal liquid-like plasmonic arrays","id":"5242bd69-727a-462e-850f-2b196249c97a"}
{"abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy generally associated with poor prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) continues to be the most potent anti-leukemia treatment for adult patients with intermediate and high-risk AML. However, disease relapse after alloHCT remains unacceptably high and is the primary cause of treatment failure and mortality following alloHCT. It is therefore that post-transplant early cellular or pharmacologic maintenance or preemptive strategies to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect or to eradicate persistent minimal residual disease have been of renewed interest, particularly with the availability of more sensitive technologies to measure residual AML. Although preliminary studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of post-alloHCT remission therapies, prospective randomized trials are required to determine their clinical efficacy and role in the treatment of AML. On behalf of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we summarize the available evidence on the use and efficacy of available pharmacologic post-remission therapies, including hypomethylating agents, deacetylase inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as cellular therapies, including preemptive and prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions for the prevention of relapse of AML.","authors":"Catherine J.

{"abstract":"The rise of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms constitutes an increasingly serious threat to global public health. As a consequence, the efficacy of conventional antimicrobials is rapidly declining, threatening the ability of healthcare professionals to cure common infections. Over the last two decades host defense peptides have been identified as an attractive source of new antimicrobials. In the present study, we characterized the antibacterial and mechanistic properties of D-Cateslytin (D-Ctl), a new epipeptide derived from L-Cateslytin, where all L-amino acids were replaced by D-amino acids. We demonstrated that D-Ctl emerges as a potent, safe and robust peptide antimicrobial with undetectable susceptibility to resistance. Using Escherichia coli as a model, we reveal that D-Ctl targets the bacterial cell wall leading to the permeabilization of the membrane and the death of the bacteria. Overall, D-Ctl offers many assets that make it an attractive candidate for the biopharmaceutical development of new antimicrobials either as a single therapy or as a combination therapy as D-Ctl also has the remarkable property to potentiate several antimicrobials of reference such as cefotaxime, amoxicillin and methicillin.","authors":"Abdurraouf Zaet; Pauline Dartevelle; Fadoua Daouad; Claire Ehlinger; Fabienne Quilès; Grégory Francius; Christian Boehler; Camille Bergthold; Benoît Frisch; Gilles Prévost; Philippe Lavalle; Francis Schneider; Youssef Haïkel; Marie-Hélène Metz-Boutigue; Céline Marban","keywords":"Antibiotics; Antimicrobial resistance","organization_affiliated":"Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Lorraine, Laboratoire de Chimie Physique et Microbiologie pour l’Environnement, LCPME, UMR 7564, 54600 Villers-lès, Nancy, France; CNRS, Laboratoire de Chimie Physique et Microbiologie pour l’Environnement, LCPME, UMR 7564, 54600 Villers-lès, Nancy, France; Université de Lorraine, Laboratoire de Chimie Physique et Microbiologie pour l’Environnement, LCPME, UMR 7564, 54600 Villers-lès, Nancy, France; CNRS, Laboratoire de Chimie Physique et Microbiologie pour l’Environnement, LCPME, UMR 7564, 54600 Villers-lès, Nancy, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Laboratoire de Conception et Applications des Molécules Bioactives, Faculté de Pharmacie, UMR 7199 CNRS/Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, CHRU Strasbourg, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, VBP EA/7290, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Service de Réanimation Médicale, Hôpital de Hautepierre, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France; Université de Strasbourg, Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, 3 rue Sainte Elisabeth, Strasbourg, France; Inserm UMR 1121, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, 11 rue Humann, Strasbourg, France","title":"D-Cateslytin, a new antimicrobial peptide with therapeutic potential","id":"f8684a2b-7a9f-4f1d-b88c-b91bda6969e5"}
{"abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally accompanied by high mortality and low cure rate. CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (CEBPs) are transcriptional regulators that play a key role in maintaining liver function. Altered expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ occurs in many tumours including HCC. saRNAs are small double-stranded RNAs that enhance target gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this report, we activate CEPBA with saRNAs and suppress CEBPB with siRNAs in cells that represent three different degrees of HCC. We performed functional assays to investigate the effects of enhancing C/EBPα and its downstream targets, p21 and albumin across these lines. We also used Mass-spectrometry (MS) subsequent to a ChIP pull-down assay to characterise the components of the protein complex involved in regulating saRNA function. Putative saRNA interacting protein candidates that were identified by MS were knocked-down with siRNAs to investigate its impact on saRNA activity. We confirmed CEBPA-saRNA decreased proliferation and migration in the differentiated lines (HepG3/Hep3B). The undifferentiated line (PLCPRF5) showed saRNA-induced increase in CEBPA but with no loss in proliferation. This effect was reversed when CEBPB was suppressed with CEBPB-siRNA. When interrogating saRNA mode of action; three saRNA interacting proteins, CTR9, HnRNPA2/B1 and DDX5 were identified by MS. Targeted knock-down of these two proteins (by siRNA) abrogated saRNA activity. This study provides insight into how different HCC lines are affected by CEBPA-saRNAs and that endogenous abundance of CEBPB and saRNA accessory proteins may dictate efficacy of CEBPA-saRNA when used in a therapeutic context.","authors":"Xiaoyang Zhao; Vikash Reebye; Paul Hitchen; Jia Fan; Hongchi Jiang; Pål Sætrom; John Rossi; Nagy.

{"abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and has not been fully understood. C10orf99 was a recently identified human antimicrobial peptide whose mRNA expression is elevated in psoriatic human skin samples. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of C10orf99 in epidermal proliferation under inflammatory condition. We showed that C10orf99 protein was significantly up-regulated in psoriatic skin samples from patients and the ortholog gene expression levels were up-regulated in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like skin lesions in mice. Using M5-stimulated HaCaT cell line model of inflammation and a combinational approach of knockdown and overexpression of C10orf99, we demonstrated that C10orf99 could promote keratinocyte proliferation by facilitating the G1/S transition, and the pro-proliferation effect of C10orf99 was associated with the activation of the ERK1/2 and NF-κB but not the AKT pathways. Local depletion of C10orf99 by lentiviral vectors expressing C10orf99 shRNA effectively ameliorated IMQ-induced dermatitis. Taken together, these results indicate that C10orf99 plays a contributive role in psoriasis pathogenesis and may serve as a new target for psoriasis treatment.","authors":"Caifeng Chen; Na Wu; Qiqi Duan; Huizi Yang; Xin Wang; Peiwen Yang; Mengdi Zhang; Jiankang Liu; Zhi Liu; Yongping Shao; Yan Zheng","keywords":"Psoriasis; Skin diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, Shaanxi Provincial People’s Hospital, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Frontier of institute of science and technology and Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Frontier of institute of science and technology and Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA; Frontier of institute of science and technology and Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Department of Dermatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China","title":"C10orf99 contributes to the development of psoriasis by promoting the proliferation of keratinocytes","id":"25e2b626-475f-4a2c-96f2-787bcb272aaf"}
{"abstract":"Larvae of the African midge Polypedilum vanderplanki (Diptera: Chironomidae) show a form of extreme desiccation tolerance known as anhydrobiosis. The cell line Pv11 was recently established from the species, and these cells can also survive under desiccated conditions, and proliferate normally after rehydration. Here we report the identification of a new promoter, 121, which has strong constitutive transcriptional activity in Pv11 cells and promotes effective expression of exogenous genes. Using a luciferase reporter assay, this strong transcriptional activity was shown to be conserved in cell lines from various insect species, including S2 (Drosophila melanogaster, Diptera), SaPe-4 (Sarcophaga peregrina, Diptera), Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda, Lepidoptera) and Tc81 (Tribolium castaneum, Coleoptera) cells. In conjunction with an appropriate selection maker gene, the 121 promoter was able to confer zeocin resistance on SaPe-4 cells and allowed the establishment of stable SaPe-4 cell lines expressing the fluorescent protein AcGFP1; this is the first report of heterologous gene expression in this cell line. These results show the 121 promoter to be a versatile tool for exogenous gene expression in a wide range of insect cell lines, particularly useful to those from non-model insect species.","authors":"Yugo Miyata; Shoko Tokumoto; Yoichiro Sogame; Ruslan Deviatiiarov; Jun Okada; Richard Cornette; Oleg Gusev; Elena Shagimardanova; Minoru Sakurai; Takahiro Kikawada","keywords":"Expression systems; Transcription","organization_affiliated":"Center for Biological Resources and Informatics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Anhydrobiosis Research Group, Molecular Biomimetics Research Unit, Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Institute of Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Integrated Biosciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan; Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, Iwaki, Japan; Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation; Anhydrobiosis Research Group, Molecular Biomimetics Research Unit, Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Institute of Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Anhydrobiosis Research Group, Molecular Biomimetics Research Unit, Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Institute of Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation; RIKEN-KFU Translational Genomics Unit, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan; Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan; Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation; Center for Biological Resources and Informatics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Anhydrobiosis Research Group, Molecular Biomimetics Research Unit, Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Institute of Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Integrated Biosciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan","title":"Identification of a novel strong promoter from the anhydrobiotic midge, Polypedilum vanderplanki , with conserved function in various insect cell lines","id":"a4393f17-d9ce-494a-9978-15cbd987eea5"}
{"abstract":"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) of the limbs caused by Aeromonas species is an extremely rare and life-threatening skin and soft tissue infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specific characteristics and the independent predictors of mortality in patients with Aeromonas NF. Sixty-eight patients were retrospectively reviewed over an 18-year period. Differences in mortality, demographics data, comorbidities, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, microbiological analysis, empiric antibiotics treatment and clinical outcomes were compared between the non-survival and the survival groups. Twenty patients died with the mortality rate of 29.4%. The non-survival group revealed significant differences in bacteremia, monomicrobial infection, cephalosporins resistance, initial ineffective empiric antibiotics usage, chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatic dysfunction, tachypnea, shock, hemorrhagic bullae, skin necrosis, leukopenia, band polymorphonuclear neutrophils \u003e10%, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The multivariate analysis identified four variables predicting mortality: bloodstream infection, shock, skin necrosis, and initial ineffective empirical antimicrobial usage against Aeromonas. NF caused by Aeromonas spp. revealed high mortality rates, even through aggressive surgical debridement and antibacterial therapies. Identifying those independent predictors, such as bacteremia, shock, progressive skin necrosis, monomicrobial infection, and application of the effective antimicrobial agents against Aeromonas under the supervision of infectious doctors, may improve clinical outcomes.","authors":"Tsung-Yu Huang; Kuo-Ti Peng; Wei-Hsiu Hsu; Chien-Hui Hung; Fang-Yi Chuang; Yao-Hung Tsai","keywords":"Diseases; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Nursing, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Chiayi Campus, Chiayi, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Department of Chinese Medicine, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Chiayi, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Department of Chinese Medicine, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Chiayi, Taiwan; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; Department of Chinese Medicine, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Chiayi, Taiwan","title":"Independent Predictors of Mortality for Aeromonas Necrotizing Fasciitis of Limbs: An 18-year Retrospective Study","id":"52450c37-2456-4362-9c2a-7b58f26e9635"}
{"abstract":"Recent advances in fluorescence super-resolution microscopy have allowed subcellular features and synthetic nanostructures down to 10–20 nm in size to be imaged. However, the direct optical observation of individual molecular targets (∼5 nm) in a densely packed biomolecular cluster remains a challenge. Here, we show that such discrete molecular imaging is possible using DNA-PAINT (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography)—a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that exploits programmable transient oligonucleotide hybridization—on synthetic DNA nanostructures. We examined the effects of a high photon count, high blinking statistics and an appropriate blinking duty cycle on imaging quality, and developed a software-based drift correction method that achieves \u003c1 nm residual drift (root mean squared) over hours. This allowed us to image a densely packed triangular lattice pattern with ∼5 nm point-to-point distance and to analyse the DNA origami structural offset with ångström-level precision (2 Å) from single-molecule studies. By combining the approach with multiplexed exchange-PAINT imaging, we further demonstrated an optical nanodisplay with 5 × 5 nm pixel size and three distinct colours with \u003c1 nm cross-channel registration accuracy. DNA-PAINT, a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that exploits programmable transient oligonucleotide hybridization, can be used to image densely packed triangular lattice patterns with molecular-level resolution and ångström-level precision.","authors":"Mingjie Dai; Ralf Jungmann; Peng Yin","keywords":"DNA nanostructures; Imaging techniques; Nanometrology; Nanostructures; Super-resolution microscopy","organization_affiliated":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Biophysics Program, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Present address: Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry and LMU, Munich 82152, Germany, ; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","title":"Optical imaging of individual biomolecules in densely packed clusters","id":"bad2e6ae-cbce-4369-a236-f9d88980f7d9"}
{"abstract":"Therizinosaurian theropods evolved many highly specialized osteological features in association with their bulky proportions, which were unusual in the context of the generally gracile Theropoda. Here we report a new therizinosaur, Lingyuanosaurus sihedangensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a specimen recovered from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of Lingyuan, Liaoning Province, China, which displays a combination of plesiomorphic and derived features. Most notably, the specimen is characterized by posterior dorsal vertebrae with a complex and unusual laminar structure; an ilium with a highly dorsoventrally expanded preacetabular process showing only slight lateral flaring of the ventral margin, a strongly anterodorsally inclined iliac blade, a small postacetabular process with a strongly concave dorsal margin, and a relatively robust pubic peduncle with a posteroventrally facing distal articular surface; a straight and robust femur with a small lesser trochanter; and a tibia that is longer than the femur. Phylogenetic analysis places Lingyuanosaurus in an intermediate position within Therizinosauria, i.e., between the early-branching therizinosaurs such as Falcarius, Jianchangosaurus, and Beipiaosaurus and the late-branching ones such as Alxasaurus and Therizinosaurus. This new therizinosaur sheds additional light on the evolution of major therizinosaurian characteristics, including particularly the distinctive pelvic girdle and hindlimb morphology seen in this group.","authors":"Xi Yao; Chun-Chi Liao; Corwin Sullivan; Xing Xu","keywords":"Palaeontology; Taxonomy","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Philip J.

{"abstract":"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E1 protein is the only viral protein with enzymatic activity. The main known function of this protein is the regulation of the viral DNA replication. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the ablation of HPV18 E1 mRNA in HeLa cells promotes a deregulation of several genes, particularly those involved in host defense mechanisms against viral infections; however, the specific contribution of E1 protein in HPV-independent context has not been studied. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of the HPV E1 protein in the regulation of cellular gene expression profiles evaluated through RNA-seq. We found that E1 proteins from HPV16 and 18 induced an overexpression of different set of genes associated with proliferation and differentiation processes, as well as downregulation of immune response genes, including IFNβ1 and IFNλ1 and Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), which are important components involved in the antiviral immune response. Together, our results indicate that HR-(High-Risk) and LR-(Low-Risk) HPV E1 proteins play an important role in inhibiting the anti-viral immune response.","authors":"Leonardo Josué Castro-Muñoz; Joaquín Manzo-Merino; J.

{"abstract":"Lily is a well-known ornamental plant with a diversity of fragrant types. Basic information on lily floral scent compounds has been obtained for only a few accessions, and little is known about Lilium aroma types, the terpene synthase genes that may play roles in the production of key volatiles, or the range of monoterpenes that these genes produce. In this study, 41 cultivars were analyzed for volatile emissions, and a total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, 16 for the first time in lilies. Lily accessions were classified into six groups according to the composition of major scent components: faint-scented, cool, fruity, musky, fruity-honey, and lily. Monoterpenes were one of the main groups of volatiles identified, and attention was focused on terpene synthase (TPS) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the last steps in monoterpene synthesis. Thirty-two candidate monoterpene synthase cDNAs were obtained from 66 lily cultivars, and 64 SNPs were identified. Two InDels were also shown to result from variable splicing, and sequence analysis suggested that different transcripts arose from the same gene. All identified nucleotide substitution sites were highly correlated with the amounts of myrcene emitted, and InDel site 230 was highly correlated with the emission of all major monoterpenoid components, especially (E)-β-ocimene. Heterologous expression of five cDNAs cloned from faint-scented and strong-scented lilies showed that their corresponding enzymes could convert geranyl diphosphate to (E)-β-ocimene, α-pinene, and limonene. The findings from this study provide a major resource for the assessment of lily scent volatiles and will be helpful in breeding of improved volatile components.","authors":"Fang Du; Ting Wang; Jun-miao Fan; Zhi-zhi Liu; Jia-xin Zong; Wei-xin Fan; Yuan-huai Han; Donald Grierson","keywords":"Secondary metabolism; Transcriptomics","organization_affiliated":"College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nangjing, China; College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Experimental Teaching Center, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; College of Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Plant \u0026 Crop Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Loughborough, UK; Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture \u0026 Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","title":"Volatile composition and classification of Lilium flower aroma types and identification, polymorphisms, and alternative splicing of their monoterpene synthase genes","id":"a34baf20-2ae0-4434-971f-6b01843738c6"}
{"abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall and the primary underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. Data from in vivo imaging, cell-lineage tracing and knockout studies in mice, as well as clinical interventional studies and advanced mRNA sequencing techniques, have drawn attention to the role of T cells as critical drivers and modifiers of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. CD4+ T cells are commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. A large body of evidence indicates that T helper 1 (TH1) cells have pro-atherogenic roles and regulatory T (Treg) cells have anti-atherogenic roles. However, Treg cells can become pro-atherogenic. The roles in atherosclerosis of other TH cell subsets such as TH2, TH9, TH17, TH22, follicular helper T cells and CD28null T cells, as well as other T cell subsets including CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells, are less well understood. Moreover, some T cells seem to have both pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic functions. In this Review, we summarize the knowledge on T cell subsets, their functions in atherosclerosis and the process of T cell homing to atherosclerotic plaques. Much of our understanding of the roles of T cells in atherosclerosis is based on findings from experimental models. Translating these findings into human disease is challenging but much needed. T cells and their specific cytokines are attractive targets for developing new preventive and therapeutic approaches including potential T cell-related therapies for atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence supports the critical role of T cells as drivers and modifiers of atherosclerosis. In this Review, Ley and colleagues describe the latest advances in our understanding of the role of T cell subsets in atherosclerosis, discuss the process of T cell homing to atherosclerotic plaques and highlight potential T cell-related therapies for atherosclerosis.

{"abstract":"The topography of the default mode network (DMN) can be obtained with one of two different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods: either from the spontaneous but organized synchrony of the low-frequency fluctuations in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), known as “functional connectivity”, or from the consistent and robust deactivations in task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI), here referred to as the “negative BOLD response” (NBR). These two methods are fundamentally different, but their results are often used interchangeably to describe the brain’s resting-state, baseline, or intrinsic activity. While the DMN was initially defined by consistent task-based decreases in blood flow in a set of specific brain regions using PET imaging, recently nearly all studies on the DMN employ functional connectivity in rs-fMRI. In this study, we first show the high level of spatial overlap between NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN extracted from the same tb-fMRI scan; then, we demonstrate that the NBR in putative DMN regions can be significantly altered without causing any change in their overlapping functional connectivity. Furthermore, we present evidence that in the DMN, the NBR is more closely related to task performance than the functional connectivity. We conclude that the NBR and functional connectivity of the DMN reflect two separate but overlapping neurophysiological processes, and thus should be differentiated in studies investigating brain-behavior relationships in both healthy and diseased populations. Our findings further raise the possibility that the macro-scale networks of the human brain might internally exhibit a hierarchical functional architecture.","authors":"David B. Parker; Qolamreza R.

{"abstract":"Grey mould is an important necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes huge economic losses in agriculture. Many types of bacteria are used for biological control of grey mould via competition for space or nutrients and/or the production of antifungal metabolites. Oxalate is a key component of virulent necrotic fungal pathogens. In this study, we isolated non-antifungal oxalate-degrading bacteria (ODB) from the surfaces of oxalate-rich spinach and strawberries to investigate their ability to control necrotic fungal pathogens such as grey mould. A total of 36 bacteria grown on oxalate minimal (OM) agar plates were tested for oxalate-degrading activity. Five isolates exhibiting the highest oxalate degradation activity were subjected to molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Two isolates exhibiting non-antifungal activity were subjected to disease suppression assays using Arabidopsis–Botrytis systems. The isolate Pseudomonas abietaniphila ODB36, which exhibited significant plant protective ability, was finally selected for further investigation. Based on whole-genome information, the pseudomonad oxalate degrading (podA) gene, which encodes formyl-CoA transferase, was analysed. The podA− mutant did not inhibit Botrytis infection and oxalate toxicity; the defects were recovered by podA complementation. Purified PodA–His converted oxalate to formate and eliminated oxalate toxicity. These results indicate that P. abietaniphila ODB36 and PodA enzyme are associated with various aspects of grey mould disease inhibitory effects.","authors":"Yeyeong Lee; Okhee Choi; Byeongsam Kang; Juyoung Bae; Seunghoe Kim; Jinwoo Kim","keywords":"Applied microbiology; Bacterial techniques and applications","organization_affiliated":"Department of Plant Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Institute of Agriculture \u0026 Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Department of Plant Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Department of Plant Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Institute of Agriculture \u0026 Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea; Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of Korea","title":"Grey mould control by oxalate degradation using non-antifungal Pseudomonas abietaniphila strain ODB36","id":"8c550a18-d35c-44f1-a145-996477d476c4"}
{"abstract":"Crohn’s disease (CD) is associated with an ecological imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, consisting of hundreds of species. The underlying complexity as well as individual differences between patients contributes to the difficulty to define a standardized treatment. Computational modeling can systematically investigate metabolic interactions between gut microbes to unravel mechanistic insights. In this study, we integrated metagenomic data of CD patients and healthy controls with genome-scale metabolic models into personalized in silico microbiotas. We predicted short chain fatty acid (SFCA) levels for patients and controls, which were overall congruent with experimental findings. As an emergent property, low concentrations of SCFA were predicted for CD patients and the SCFA signatures were unique to each patient. Consequently, we suggest personalized dietary treatments that could improve each patient’s SCFA levels. The underlying modeling approach could aid clinical practice to find dietary treatment and guide recovery by rationally proposing food aliments. Modeling of the human gut microbiota metabolism predicts that fiber-containing diets can improve the microbe metabolism in Crohn’s disease (CD). By integrating metagenomic data from human gut samples into personalized metabolic models, the fermentation profile of gut microbes and the differences between CD patients and healthy controls were assessed. To revert the fermentation differences between healthy and CD individuals, predicted beneficial metabolites were added to the in silico gut community models, with which the fermentation profile of CD patients could be improved. Taken together, these results can assist in the design of further experimental and clinical studies to aid CD patients with dietary supplementation.","authors":"Eugen Bauer; Ines Thiele","keywords":"Biochemical networks; Computer modelling; Systems analysis","organization_affiliated":"Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, Universite du Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, Universite du Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","title":"From metagenomic data to personalized in silico microbiotas: predicting dietary supplements for Crohn’s disease","id":"7f56a442-1e4f-4050-bfb2-460d11cd9542"}
{"abstract":"Widespread tree mortality associated with drought has been observed on all forested continents and global change is expected to exacerbate vegetation vulnerability. Forest mortality has implications for future biosphere–atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy balance, and is poorly represented in dynamic vegetation models. Reducing uncertainty requires improved mortality projections founded on robust physiological processes. However, the proposed mechanisms of drought-induced mortality, including hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are unresolved. A growing number of empirical studies have investigated these mechanisms, but data have not been consistently analysed across species and biomes using a standardized physiological framework. Here, we show that xylem hydraulic failure was ubiquitous across multiple tree taxa at drought-induced mortality. All species assessed had 60% or higher loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, consistent with proposed theoretical and modelled survival thresholds. We found diverse responses in non-structural carbohydrate reserves at mortality, indicating that evidence supporting carbon starvation was not universal. Reduced non-structural carbohydrates were more common for gymnosperms than angiosperms, associated with xylem hydraulic vulnerability, and may have a role in reducing hydraulic function. Our finding that hydraulic failure at drought-induced mortality was persistent across species indicates that substantial improvement in vegetation modelling can be achieved using thresholds in hydraulic function. The mechanisms underlying drought-induced tree mortality are not fully resolved. Here, the authors show that, across multiple tree species, loss of xylem conductivity above 60% is associated with mortality, while carbon starvation is not universal.","authors":"Henry D.

The most significant SNPs were replicated in a separate sample set of 130 patients and 288 controls. A two-SNP haplotype of intronic and missense SNPs showed the strongest association. The intronic SNP is strongly associated with PLA2R1 expression in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and the missense SNP is predicted to alter peptide binding with HLA-DRB1*15:01 by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). In HLA region, we performed relative predispositional effect (RPE) tests and identified additional risk alleles in both HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. We collapsed the risk alleles in each of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 into single risk alleles. Reciprocal conditioning of these collapsed risk alleles showed more residual significance for HLA-DRB1 collapsed risk than HLA-DQB1 collapsed risk. These results indicate that changes in the expression levels of structurally different PLA2R protein confer risk for IMN in the presence of risk HLA-DRB1 alleles.","authors":"Khun Zaw Latt; Kenjiro Honda; Myo Thiri; Yuki Hitomi; Yosuke Omae; Hiromi Sawai; Yosuke Kawai; Shunsuke Teraguchi; Kazuko Ueno; Masao Nagasaki; Akihiko Mabuchi; Hajime Kaga; Atsushi Komatsuda; Katsushi Tokunaga; Eisei Noiri","keywords":"Genetics research; Membranous nephropathy","organization_affiliated":"Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Nephrology and Endocrinology, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Integrative Genomics, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Integrative Genomics, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Akita University, Akita, Japan; Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Akita University, Akita, Japan; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Nephrology and Endocrinology, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Hemodialysis and Apheresis, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan","title":"Identification of a two-SNP PLA2R1 Haplotype and HLA-DRB1 Alleles as Primary Risk Associations in Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy","id":"1dc0115e-369d-4429-93dc-941a9ac8b241"}
{"abstract":"Single crystals are typically brittle, inelastic materials. Such mechanical responses limit their use in practical applications, particularly in flexible electronics and optical devices. Here we describe single crystals of a well-known coordination compound—copper(II) acetylacetonate—that are flexible enough to be reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanical measurements indicate that the crystals exhibit an elasticity similar to that of soft materials such as nylon, and thus display properties normally associated with both hard and soft matter. Using microfocused synchrotron radiation, we mapped the changes in crystal structure that occur on bending, and determined the mechanism that allows this flexibility with atomic precision. We show that, under strain, the molecules in the crystal reversibly rotate, and thus reorganize to allow the mechanical compression and expansion required for elasticity and still maintain the integrity of the crystal structure. Crystals are typically thought to be brittle and fragile materials, but needles of copper(II) acetylacetonate have now been shown to be flexible enough to be reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanistic investigations using synchrotron X-ray diffraction determined that the elastic bending occurs through rotation of the molecules within the crystal lattice.

{"abstract":"The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 released an unprecedented amount of petroleum hydrocarbons 1500 meters below the sea surface. Few studies have considered the influence of hydrostatic pressure on bacterial community development and activity during such spills. The goal of this study was to investigate the response of indigenous sediment microbial communities to the combination of increased pressure, hydrocarbons and dispersant. Deep-sea sediment samples collected from the northern Gulf of Mexico were incubated at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) and at elevated pressure (10 MPa), with and without the addition of crude oil and dispersant. After incubations at 4 °C for 7 days, Colwellia and Psychrobium were highly abundant in all samples. Pressure differentially impacted members of the Alteromonadales. The influences of pressure on the composition of bacterial communities were most pronounced when dispersant was added to the incubations. Moritella and Thalassotalea were greatly stimulated by the addition of dispersant, suggesting their roles in dispersant biodegradation. However, Moritella was negatively impacted by increasing pressure. The presence of dispersant was shown to decrease the relative abundance of a known hydrocarbon degrader, Cycloclasticus, while increasing pressure increased its relative abundance. This study highlights the significant influence of pressure on the development of microbial communities in the presence of oil and dispersant during oil spills and related response strategies in the deep sea.","authors":"Nuttapol Noirungsee; Steffen Hackbusch; Juan Viamonte; Paul Bubenheim; Andreas Liese; Rudolf Müller","keywords":"Microbial ecology; Water microbiology","organization_affiliated":"Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany; Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany; Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany; Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany; Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany; Hamburg University of Technology, Institute of Technical Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany","title":"Influence of oil, dispersant, and pressure on microbial communities from the Gulf of Mexico","id":"46f8d60e-861a-44ef-8c08-7d67634d3c41"}
{"abstract":"Ginseng (Panax ginseng) and its bioactive components, ginsenosides, are popular medicinal herbal products, exhibiting various pharmacological effects. Despite their advocated use for medication, the long cultivation periods of ginseng roots and their low ginsenoside content prevent mass production of this compound. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered for production of protopanaxadiol (PPD), a type of aglycone characterizing ginsenoside. PPD-producing yeast cell factory was further engineered by obtaining a balance between enzyme expressions and altering cofactor availability. Different combinations of promoters (PGPD, PCCW12, and PADH2) were utilized to construct the PPD biosynthetic pathway. Rerouting the redox metabolism to improve NADPH availability in the engineered S. cerevisiae also increased PPD production. Combining these approaches resulted in more than an 11-fold increase in PPD titer over the initially constructed strain. The series of metabolic engineering strategies of this study provides a feasible approach for the microbial production of PPD and development of microbial platforms producing other industrially-relevant terpenoids.","authors":"Jae-Eung Kim; In-Seung Jang; Bong Hyun Sung; Sun Chang Kim; Ju Young Lee","keywords":"Metabolic engineering","organization_affiliated":"Center for Bio-based Chemistry, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), Jung-gu, Republic of Korea; Center for Bio-based Chemistry, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), Jung-gu, Republic of Korea; Cell Factory Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Center for Bio-based Chemistry, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), Jung-gu, Republic of Korea","title":"Rerouting of NADPH synthetic pathways for increased protopanaxadiol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","id":"eeff3e4d-a9bb-461e-a335-5c11d0606205"}
{"abstract":"In advanced prostate cancer, CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) binding protein (CBP) and its homolog EP300 are highly expressed; targeting the bromodomain of CBP is a new strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the current study we identified Y08197, a novel 1-(indolizin-3-yl) ethanone derivative, as a selective inhibitor of CBP/EP300 bromodomain and explored its antitumor activity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. In the AlphaScreen assay, we demonstrated that Y08197 dose-dependently inhibited the CBP bromodomain with an IC50 value at 100.67 ± 3.30 nM. Y08197 also exhibited high selectivity for CBP/EP300 over other bromodomain-containing proteins. In LNCaP, 22Rv1 and VCaP prostate cancer cells, treatment with Y08197 (1, 5 μM) strongly affected downstream signaling transduction, thus markedly inhibiting the expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes PSA, KLK2, TMPRSS2, and oncogenes C-MYC and ERG. Notably, Y08197 potently inhibited cell growth in several AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines including LNCaP, 22Rv1, VCaP, and C4-2B. In 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, treatment with Y08197 (1, 4, 16 μM) dose-dependently induced G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with Y08197 (5 μM) significantly decreased ERG-induced invasive capacity of 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells detected in wound-healing assay and cell migration assay. Taken together, CBP/EP300 inhibitor Y08197 represents a promising lead compound for development as new therapeutics for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.","authors":"Ling-jiao Zou; Qiu-ping Xiang; Xiao-qian Xue; Cheng Zhang; Chen-chang Li; Chao Wang; Qiu Li; Rui Wang; Shuang Wu; Yu-lai Zhou; Yan Zhang; Yong Xu","keywords":"Biomedicine, general; Pharmacology/Toxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine","organization_affiliated":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China; School of Life Science, Huizhou University, Huizhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biocomputing, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China","title":"Y08197 is a novel and selective CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer","id":"17d0d0b9-320a-4ca9-97da-2dae6e0602bd"}
{"abstract":"Neuronal communication relies on synaptic vesicles undergoing regulated exocytosis and recycling for multiple rounds of fusion. Whether all synaptic vesicles have identical protein content has been challenged, suggesting that their recycling ability may differ greatly. Botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNT/A) is a highly potent neurotoxin that is internalized in synaptic vesicles at motor nerve terminals and induces flaccid paralysis. Recently, BoNT/A was also shown to undergo retrograde transport, suggesting it might enter a specific pool of synaptic vesicles with a retrograde trafficking fate. Using high-resolution microscopy techniques including electron microscopy and single molecule imaging, we found that the BoNT/A binding domain is internalized within a subset of vesicles that only partially co-localize with cholera toxin B-subunit and have markedly reduced VAMP2 immunoreactivity. Synaptic vesicles loaded with pHrodo-BoNT/A-Hc exhibited a significantly reduced ability to fuse with the plasma membrane in mouse hippocampal nerve terminals when compared with pHrodo-dextran-containing synaptic vesicles and pHrodo-labeled anti-GFP nanobodies bound to VAMP2-pHluorin or vGlut-pHluorin. Similar results were also obtained at the amphibian neuromuscular junction. These results reveal that BoNT/A is internalized in a subpopulation of synaptic vesicles that are not destined to recycle, highlighting the existence of significant molecular and functional heterogeneity between synaptic vesicles.","authors":"Callista B.

{"abstract":"Ferroelastic domain switching significantly affects piezoelectric properties in ferroelectric materials. The ferroelastic domain switching and the lattice deformation of both a-domains and c-domains under an applied electric field were investigated using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction in conjunction with a high-speed pulse generator set up for epitaxial (100)/(001)-oriented tetragonal Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (PZT) films grown on (100) c SrRuO3//(100)KTaO3 substrates. The 004 peak (c-domain) position shifts to a lower 2θ angle, which demonstrates the elongation of the c-axis lattice parameter of the c-domain under an applied electric field. In contrast, the 400 peak (a-domain) shifts in the opposite direction (higher angle), thus indicating a decrease in the a-axis lattice parameter of the a-domain. 90° domain switching from (100) to (001) orientations (from a-domain to c-domain) was observed by a change in the intensities of the 400 and 004 diffraction peaks by applying a high-speed pulsed electric field 200 ns in width. This change also accompanied a tilt in the angles of each domain from the substrate surface normal direction. This behaviour proved that the 90° domain switched within 40 ns under a high-speed pulsed electric field. Direct observation of such high-speed switching opens the way to design piezo-MEMS devices for high-frequency operation.","authors":"Yoshitaka Ehara; Shintaro Yasui; Takahiro Oikawa; Takahisa Shiraishi; Takao Shimizu; Hiroki Tanaka; Noriyuki Kanenko; Ronald Maran; Tomoaki Yamada; Yasuhiko Imai; Osami Sakata; Nagarajan Valanoor; Hiroshi Funakubo","keywords":"Ceramics; Characterization and analytical techniques; Ferroelectrics and multiferroics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Laboratory for Materials and Structures, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, 2-1-1 Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan; Materials Research Center for Element Strategy, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Department of Materials, Physics and Energy Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan; Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI), 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo, Japan; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Synchrotron X-ray Station at SPring-8 and Synchrotron X-ray Group, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo, Hyogo, Japan; School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Department of Innovative and Engineered Material, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Materials Research Center for Element Strategy, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan","title":"In-situ observation of ultrafast 90° domain switching under application of an electric field in (100)/(001)-oriented tetragonal epitaxial Pb(Zr 0.4 Ti 0.6 )O 3 thin films","id":"9d0b2f5b-5e11-415e-98a3-58e766589c7f"}
{"abstract":"This pilot study aimed to investigate the utility of near-infrared spectroscopy/indocyanine green (NIRS/ICG) for examining patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Twenty-nine patients with chronic-stage atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular disease were included. The patients were monitored using NIRS at the bedside. Using ICG time-intensity curves, the affected-to-unaffected side ratios were calculated for several parameters, including the maximum ICG concentration (ΔICGmax), time to peak (TTP), rise time (RT), and blood flow index (BFI = ΔICGmax/RT), and were compared to the affected-to-unaffected side ratios of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) obtained using positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled gas. The BFI ratio showed the best correlation with the rCBF ratio among these parameters (r = 0.618; P = 0.0004), and the RT ratio showed the best correlation with the rOEF ratio (r = 0.593; P = 0.0007). The patients were further divided into reduced rCBF or elevated rOEF groups, and the analysis revealed significant related differences. The present results advance the measurement of ICG kinetics using NIRS as a useful tool for the detection of severely impaired perfusion with reduced rCBF or elevated rOEF. This method may be applicable as a monitoring tool for patients with acute ischemic stroke.","authors":"Hiroshi Saito; Tatsuya Ishikawa; Jun Tanabe; Shinya Kobayashi; Junta Moroi","keywords":"Fluorescence imaging; Stroke","organization_affiliated":"Department of Surgical Neurology, Research Institute for Brain and Blood Vessels-AKITA, Akita, Japan; Department of Neurosurgery, Kameda medical center, Chiba, Japan; Department of Surgical Neurology, Research Institute for Brain and Blood Vessels-AKITA, Akita, Japan; Department of Surgical Neurology, Research Institute for Brain and Blood Vessels-AKITA, Akita, Japan; Department of Surgical Neurology, Research Institute for Brain and Blood Vessels-AKITA, Akita, Japan; Department of Surgical Neurology, Research Institute for Brain and Blood Vessels-AKITA, Akita, Japan","title":"Bedside assessment of regional cerebral perfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy and indocyanine green in patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease","id":"f3f93e1f-cf48-4e16-9eb6-3a943f9e3728"}
{"abstract":"The link between antibiotic treatment and IF-associated liver disease (IFALD) is unclear. Here, we study the effect of antibiotic treatment on bile acid (BA) metabolism and investigate the involved mechanisms. The results showed that pediatric IF patients with cholestasis had a significantly lower abundance of BA-biotransforming bacteria than patients without cholestasis. In addition, the BA composition was altered in the serum, feces, and liver of pediatric IF patients with cholestasis, as reflected by the increased proportion of primary BAs. In the ileum, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression was reduced in patients with cholestasis. Correspondingly, the serum FGF19 levels decreased significantly in patients with cholestasis. In the liver, the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in bile salt synthesis, cytochrome P450 7a1 (CYP7A1), increased noticeably in IF patients with cholestasis. In mice, we showed that oral antibiotics (gentamicin, GM or vancomycin, VCM) reduced colonic microbial diversity, with a decrease in both Gram-negative bacteria (GM affected Eubacterium and Bacteroides) and Gram-positive bacteria (VCM affected Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus). Concomitantly, treatment with GM or VCM decreased secondary BAs in the colonic contents, with a simultaneous increase in primary BAs in plasma. Moreover, the changes in the colonic BA profile especially that of tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TβMCA), were predominantly associated with the inhibition of the FXR and further altered BA synthesis and transport. In conclusion, the administration of antibiotics significantly decreased the intestinal microbiota diversity and subsequently altered the BA composition. The alterations in BA composition contributed to cholestasis in IF patients by regulating FXR signaling. Using antibiotics during intestinal failure in children may lead to the development of liver disease. Microbiota in the gut play vital roles in balancing the digestive system, including transforming bile acids (BAs) secreted by the liver into forms that help us digest food. Wai Cai and Ying Wang at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China and co-workers examined samples from 46 children treated with antibiotics for intestinal failure. The patients who also had cholestasis – disrupted production and flow of bile – had far fewer BA-transforming bacteria in their gut than those without cholestasis. They also had altered expression of a crucial BA receptor protein. Experiments on mice showed that treatment with two different antibiotics reduced microbiota diversity, which in turn influenced BA receptor signaling and altered BA composition, contributing to cholestasis.","authors":"Yongtao Xiao; Kejun Zhou; Ying Lu; Weihui Yan; Wei Cai; Ying Wang","keywords":"Colitis; Experimental models of disease","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pediatric Surgery, Xin Hua Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Pediatric Research, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Pediatric Research, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Pediatric Research, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China; Department of Pediatric Surgery, Xin Hua Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China; Department of Pediatric Surgery, Xin Hua Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Pediatric Research, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China; Department of Pediatric Surgery, Xin Hua Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Shanghai, China","title":"Administration of antibiotics contributes to cholestasis in pediatric patients with intestinal failure via the alteration of FXR signaling","id":"753dce02-df21-4eea-b4c4-91b916284fb5"}
{"abstract":"Using NASA MERRA2 daily data, we investigated the origin, maintenance and variability of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in relation to variations of the Asia Monsoon Anticyclone (AMA) during the summer of 2008. During May-June, abundant quantities of carbon monoxide (CO), carbonaceous aerosols (CA) and dusts are found in the mid- and upper troposphere over India and China, arising from enhanced biomass burning emissions, as well as westerly transport from the Middle East deserts. During July-August, large quantities of dusts transported from the deserts are trapped and accumulate over the southern and eastern foothills of the Tibetan Plateau. Despite strong precipitation washout, ambient CO, CA and dust are lofted by orographically forced deep convection to great elevations, 12–16 km above sea level, via two key pathways over heavily polluted regions: a) the Himalayas-Gangetic Plain, and b) the Sichuan Basin. Upon entering the upper-troposphere-lower-stratosphere, the pollutants are capped by a stable layer near the tropopause, advected and dispersed by the anticyclonic circulation of AMA, forming the ATAL resembling a planetary-scale “double-stem chimney cloud”. The development and variability of the ATAL are strongly linked to the seasonal march and intraseasonal (20–30 days and higher frequency) oscillations of the Asian monsoon.","authors":"William K. M.

{"abstract":"The efficient delivery of light energy is a prerequisite for the non-invasive imaging and stimulating of target objects embedded deep within a scattering medium. However, the injected waves experience random diffusion by multiple light scattering, and only a small fraction reaches the target object. Here, we present a method to counteract wave diffusion and to focus multiple-scattered waves at the deeply embedded target. To realize this, we experimentally inject light into the reflection eigenchannels of a specific flight time to preferably enhance the intensity of those multiple-scattered waves that have interacted with the target object. For targets that are too deep to be visible by optical imaging, we demonstrate a more than tenfold enhancement in light energy delivery in comparison with ordinary wave diffusion cases. This work will lay a foundation to enhance the working depth of imaging, sensing and light stimulation. The use of a time-gated reflection matrix of a scattering medium, in particular via using singular value decomposition and injecting light into the largest time-gated eigenchannel, can lead to a more than tenfold enhancement in light energy delivery in comparison with ordinary wave diffusion cases.","authors":"Seungwon Jeong; Ye-Ryoung Lee; Wonjun Choi; Sungsam Kang; Jin Hee Hong; Jin-Sung Park; Yong-Sik Lim; Hong-Gyu Park; Wonshik Choi","keywords":"Adaptive optics; Imaging and sensing","organization_affiliated":"Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Nano Science and Mechanical Engineering and Nanotechnology Research Center, Konkuk University, Chungbuk, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea","title":"Focusing of light energy inside a scattering medium by controlling the time-gated multiple light scattering","id":"126ae622-83b3-435c-9e89-6613c4882953"}

Here, we developed a new strategy to incorporate T cells into human 3D skin constructs (HSCs), which enabled us to closely monitor and quantitate T cell responses. We found that the epidermis promotes the activation and infiltration of T cells into the skin, and provides a directional cue for their selective migration towards the epidermis. We established a psoriatic HSC (pHSC) by incorporating polarized Th1/Th17 cells or CCR6+CLA+ T cells derived from psoriasis patients into the constructs. These pHSCs showed a psoriatic epidermal phenotype and characteristic cytokine profiles, and responded to various classes of psoriasis drugs, highlighting the potential utility of our model as a drug screening platform.

Genome analyses revealed that the C. tetani population is distributed in two phylogenetic clades, a major and a minor one, with no evidence for clade separation based on geographical origin or time of isolation. The chromosome of C. tetani is highly conserved; in contrast, the TeNT-encoding plasmid shows substantial heterogeneity. TeNT itself is highly conserved among all strains; the most relevant difference is an insertion of four amino acids in the C-terminal receptor-binding domain in four strains that might impact on receptor-binding properties. Other putative virulence factors, including tetanolysin and collagenase, are encoded in all genomes. This study highlights the population structure of C. tetani and suggests that tetanus-causing strains did not undergo extensive evolutionary diversification, as judged from the high conservation of its main virulence factors.","authors":"Diana Chapeton-Montes; Lucile Plourde; Christiane Bouchier; Laurence Ma; Laure Diancourt; Alexis Criscuolo; Michel Robert Popoff; Holger Brüggemann","keywords":"Bacteriology; Genetics","organization_affiliated":"Bacterial Toxins, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Sanofi-Pasteur, Marcy l′Etoile, France; Genomic Platform, Biomics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Genomic Platform, Biomics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; CNR Bactéries anaérobies Botulisme, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Hub Bioinformatique Biostatistique, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Bacterial Toxins, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Aarhus University, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus, Denmark","title":"The population structure of Clostridium tetani deduced from its pan-genome","id":"01459f11-c3da-4d57-8e5e-0c9874459f54"}
{"abstract":"The bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is evolved to attack and kill other bacteria, including the human intestinal pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Although B. bacteriovorus exhibit a broad prey range, little is known about the genetic determinants of prey resistance and sensitivity. Here we perform a genetic screen on V. cholerae and identify five pathways contributing to predation susceptibility. We find that the essential virulence regulators ToxR/S increase susceptibility to predation, as mutants of these genes are more resistant to predation. We observe by flow cytometry that lipopolysaccharide is a critical defense, as mutants lacking O-antigen are rapidly attacked by predatory B. bacteriovorus. Using polymer solutions to alter media viscosity, we find that when B. bacteriovorus attacks motile V. cholerae, increased drag forces slow its ability to prey. These results provide insights into key prey resistance mechanisms, and may be useful in the application of B. bacteriovorus in treating infections. Prey bacteria have evolved different strategies to counteract predation but the genetic basis remains unclear. Here, Duncan et al. identify key genes involved in Vibrio cholerae sensitivity to Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus predation, providing new insights into prey resistance mechanisms.","authors":"Miles C.

{"abstract":"Diffraction gratings are an essential optical component of high-power, short-pulse lasers. The maximum output of high-power pulsed lasers is always determined by laser resistance of gratings and this resistance is strongly dependent on the local near electric field intensity in the grating structure. We presented a novel method of reducing electric-field-enhancement in metal-dielectric grating by designing asymmetric grating ridge while maintaining high diffraction performance. Compared with the common isosceles trapezoidal grating, the grating with asymmetric ridge got a 0.04% reduction of diffraction efficiency in TE polarization at 1053 nm incident wavelength but a 21.3% reduction of maximal electric-field-enhancement in grating structure. This method can be applied to any surface-relief gratings to reduce the electric-field-enhancement for improving the laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of grating and supporting the grating-based chirped pulse amplification (CPA) system to develop into higher peak-power levels.","authors":"Junming Chen; Haopeng Huang; Yibing Zhang; Yonglu Wang; Fanyu Kong; Yanzhi Wang; Yunxia Jin; Peng Chen; Jiao Xu; Jianda Shao","keywords":"Laser material processing; Nanoscale devices; Optical materials and structures","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Materials for High Power Laser, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","title":"Reducing electric-field-enhancement in metal-dielectric grating by designing grating with asymmetric ridge","id":"029a50c3-d7cb-484d-893a-850d646f4546"}
{"abstract":"The observation of chemical reactions on the time scale of the motion of electrons and nuclei has been made possible by lasers with ever shortened pulse lengths. Superfluid helium represents a special solvent that permits the synthesis of novel classes of molecules that have eluded dynamical studies so far. However, photoexcitation inside this quantum solvent triggers a pronounced response of the solvation shell, which is not well understood. Here, we present a mechanistic description of the solvent response to photoexcitation of indium (In) dopant atoms inside helium nanodroplets (HeN), obtained from femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory simulations. For the In–HeN system, part of the excited state electronic energy leads to expansion of the solvation shell within 600 fs, initiating a collective shell oscillation with a period of about 30 ps. These coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics will be superimposed on intrinsic photoinduced processes of molecular systems inside helium droplets. Femtosecond laser spectroscopy has contributed to our understanding of structure and function of matter. Here, the authors explore the applicability of superfluid helium nanodroplets as a sample preparation method that allows investigation of previously inaccessible classes of tailor-made or fragile molecular systems.","authors":"Bernhard Thaler; Sascha Ranftl; Pascal Heim; Stefan Cesnik; Leonhard Treiber; Ralf Meyer; Andreas W.

{"abstract":"Thraustochytrids of the genera Schizochytrium and Aurantiochytrium accumulate oils rich in the essential, marine n3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA production in Aurantiochytrium sp T66 was studied with the aim to provide more knowledge about factors that affect the DHA-productivities and the contributions of the two enzyme systems used for fatty acid synthesis in thraustochytrids, fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and PUFA-synthase. Fermentations with nitrogen starvation, which is well-known to initiate lipid accumulation in oleaginous organisms, were compared to fermentations with nitrogen in excess, obtained by oxygen limitation. The specific productivities of fatty acids originating from FAS were considerably higher under nitrogen starvation than with nitrogen in excess, while the specific productivities of DHA were the same at both conditions. Global transcriptome analysis showed significant up-regulation of FAS under N-deficient conditions, while the PUFA-synthase genes were only marginally upregulated. Neither of them was upregulated under O2-limitation where nitrogen was in excess, suggesting that N-starvation mainly affects the FAS and may be less important for the PUFA-synthase. The transcriptome analysis also revealed responses likely to be related to the generation of reducing power (NADPH) for fatty acid synthesis.","authors":"Tonje M. B.

{"abstract":"Recently we demonstrated swarming of a self-propelled biomolecular motor system microtubule (MT)-kinesin where interactions among thousands of motile MTs were regulated in a highly programmable fashion by using DNA as a processor. However, precise control of this potential system is yet to be achieved to optimize the swarm behavior. In this work, we systematically controlled swarming of MTs on kinesin adhered surface by different physicochemical parameters of MT-kinesin and DNA. Tuning the length of DNA sequences swarming was precisely controlled with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. In addition, swarming was regulated using different concentration of DNA crosslinkers. Reversibility of swarming was further controlled by changing the concentration of strand displacement DNA signal allowing dissociation of swarm. The control over the swarm was accompanied by variable stiffness of MTs successfully, providing translational and circular motion. Moreover, the morphology of swarm was also found to be changed not only depending on the stiffness but also body length of MTs. Such detail study of precise control of swarming would provide new insights in developing a promising molecular swarm robotic system with desired functions.","authors":"Jakia Jannat Keya; Arif Md.

{"abstract":"Syndecan 1 (SDC-1) is a cell surface proteoglycan with a significant role in cell adhesion, maintaining epithelial integrity. SDC1 expression is inversely related to aggressiveness in prostate cancer (PCa). During epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), loss of epithelial markers is mediated by transcriptional repressors such as SNAIL, SLUG, or ZEB1/2 that bind to E-box promoter sequences of specific genes. The effect of these repressors on SDC-1 expression remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB1 expressions are increased in advanced PCa, contrarily to SDC-1. SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB1 also showed an inversion to SDC-1 in prostate cell lines. ZEB1, but not SNAIL or SLUG, represses SDC-1 as demonstrated by experiments of ectopic expression in epithelial prostate cell lines. Inversely, expression of ZEB1 shRNA in PCa cell line increased SDC-1 expression. The effect of ZEB1 is transcriptional since ectopic expression of this gene represses SDC-1 promoter activity and ZEB1 binds to the SDC-1 promoter as detected by ChIP assays. An epigenetic mark associated to transcription repression H3K27me3 was bound to the same sites that ZEB1. In conclusion, this study identifies ZEB1 as a key repressor of SDC-1 during PCa progression and point to ZEB1 as a potentially diagnostic marker for PCa.","authors":"Nancy Farfán; Nallatt Ocarez; Enrique A.

{"abstract":"As part of an ongoing study of new insulin mimetic agents from medicinal plants, the 70% EtOH extract of Symplocos cochinchinensis was found to have a stimulatory effect on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. The intensive targeted isolation of this active extract resulted in ten new hydroxyoleoside-type compounds conjugated with a phenolic acid and monoterpene (1–6 and 8–11), as well as four known compounds (7 and 12–14). The chemical structures of the new compounds were determined based on spectroscopic data analysis (1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY and MS). The absolute configurations of the isolated compounds were determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analysis of derivatives obtained after a series of reactions, such as those with dirhodium (ІІ) tetrakis (trifluoroacetate) and dimolybdenum (ІІ) tetraacetate. In vitro, compounds 3, 7 and 8 moderately increased the 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose (2-NBDG) uptake level in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For further studies, we evaluated their effects on the expression of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), its translocation, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibition and expression of phosphorylated Akt. Our results strongly suggest that the traditional uses of this plant can be described as active constituents by hydroxyoleoside-type compounds.","authors":"Ba-Wool Lee; Thi Kim Quy Ha; Ha Thanh Tung Pham; Quynh Hoa Hoang; Van On Tran; Won Keun Oh","keywords":"Natural products","organization_affiliated":"Korea Bioactive Natural Material Bank, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Korea Bioactive Natural Material Bank, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Korea Bioactive Natural Material Bank, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Botany, Hanoi University of Pharmacy, Hanoi, Vietnam; Department of Botany, Hanoi University of Pharmacy, Hanoi, Vietnam; Korea Bioactive Natural Material Bank, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"Hydroxyoleoside-type seco -iridoids from Symplocos cochinchinensis and their insulin mimetic activity","id":"409b3d3a-3f0f-4561-8c0c-86d95a8f95b0"}
{"abstract":"When we read printed text, we are continuously predicting upcoming words to integrate information and guide future eye movements. Thus, the Predictability of a given word has become one of the most important variables when explaining human behaviour and information processing during reading. In parallel, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field evolved by developing a wide variety of applications. Here, we show that using different word embeddings techniques (like Latent Semantic Analysis, Word2Vec, and FastText) and N-gram-based language models we were able to estimate how humans predict words (cloze-task Predictability) and how to better understand eye movements in long Spanish texts. Both types of models partially captured aspects of predictability. On the one hand, our N-gram model performed well when added as a replacement for the cloze-task Predictability of the fixated word. On the other hand, word embeddings were useful to mimic Predictability of the following word. Our study joins efforts from neurolinguistic and NLP fields to understand human information processing during reading to potentially improve NLP algorithms.","authors":"Bruno Bianchi; Gastón Bengolea Monzón; Luciana Ferrer; Diego Fernández Slezak; Diego E.

{"abstract":"Excitons are spin integer particles that are predicted to condense into a coherent quantum state at sufficiently low temperature. Here by using photocurrent imaging we report experimental evidence of formation and efficient transport of non-equilibrium excitons in Bi2-xSbxSe3 nanoribbons. The photocurrent distributions are independent of electric field, indicating that photoexcited electrons and holes form excitons. Remarkably, these excitons can transport over hundreds of micrometers along the topological insulator (TI) nanoribbons before recombination at up to 40 K. The macroscopic transport distance, combined with short carrier lifetime obtained from transient photocurrent measurements, indicates an exciton diffusion coefficient at least 36 m2 s−1, which corresponds to a mobility of 6 × 104 m2 V−1 s−1 at 7 K and is four order of magnitude higher than the value reported for free carriers in TIs. The observation of highly dissipationless exciton transport implies the formation of superfluid-like exciton condensate at the surface of TIs. Exciton condensation may emerge at room temperature in topological materials with strong Coulomb interactions and vanishing electron effective mass. Here, Hou et al. report the formation of excitons in Bi2-xSbxSe3 nanoribbons, which can transport over hundreds of micrometres before recombination up to 40 K, further implying exciton condensation.","authors":"Yasen Hou; Rui Wang; Rui Xiao; Luke McClintock; Henry Clark Travaglini; John Paulus Francia; Harry Fetsch; Onur Erten; Sergey Y.

Also, one may consider cluster media as a nanolab to investigate fundamental issues of intense optical fields interaction with sub-wavelength scale structures. However, conventional diagnostic methods fail to register highly charged ion states from a cluster plasma because of strong recombination in the ambient gas. In the paper we introduce high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy method allowing to study energy spectra of highly charged ions created in the area of most intense laser radiation. The emission of CO2 clusters were analyzed in experiments with 60 fs 780 nm laser pulses of 1018 W/cm2 intensity. Theory and according X-ray spectra modeling allows to reveal the energy spectra and yield of highly charged oxygen ions. It was found that while the laser of fundamental frequency creates commonly expected monotonic ion energy spectrum, frequency doubled laser radiation initiates energy spectra featuring of distinctive quasi-monoenergetic peaks.

{"abstract":"In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a protein quality control system facilitates the efficient folding of newly synthesised proteins. In this system, a series of N-linked glycan intermediates displayed on the protein surface serve as quality tags. The ER folding-sensor enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) acts as a gatekeeper in the ER quality control system by specifically catalysing monoglucosylation onto incompletely folded glycoproteins, thereby enabling them to interact with lectin–chaperone complexes. Here we characterise the dynamic structure of this enzyme. Our crystallographic data demonstrate that the sensor region is composed of four thioredoxin-like domains followed by a β-rich domain, which are arranged into a C-shaped structure with a large central cavity, while the C-terminal catalytic domain undergoes a ligand-dependent conformational alteration. Furthermore, small-angle X-ray scattering, cryo-electron microscopy and high-speed atomic force microscopy have demonstrated that UGGT has a flexible modular structure in which the smaller catalytic domain is tethered to the larger folding-sensor region with variable spatial arrangements. These findings provide structural insights into the working mechanism whereby UGGT operates as a folding-sensor against a variety of glycoprotein substrates through its flexible modular structure possessing extended hydrophobic surfaces for the recognition of unfolded substrates.","authors":"Tadashi Satoh; Chihong Song; Tong Zhu; Takayasu Toshimori; Kazuyoshi Murata; Yugo Hayashi; Hironari Kamikubo; Takayuki Uchihashi; Koichi Kato","keywords":"Atomic force microscopy; Biophysics; Electron microscopy; SAXS; X-ray crystallography","organization_affiliated":"Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Mizuho-ku, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Mizuho-ku, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Mizuho-ku, Japan; Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, Okazaki, Japan; Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; School of Physical Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Mizuho-ku, Japan; Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; School of Life Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Okazaki, Japan; Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan; Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan; Department of Physics, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Japan; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Mizuho-ku, Japan; Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, Okazaki, Japan; Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; School of Physical Sciences, Okazaki, Japan","title":"Visualisation of a flexible modular structure of the ER folding-sensor enzyme UGGT","id":"71da34a7-836d-41e2-89d6-b1fd9008257c"}
{"abstract":"Cutaneous allodynia (CA) is an abnormal pain in response to non-painful stimuli. In the present study, we sought to investigate the presence of CA, its associated factors, and its clinical implications in patients with cluster headache (CH). In this cross-sectional study, we analysed data from a prospective multicentre registry enrolling consecutive patients with CH. We identified CA during and between headache attacks using the 12-item Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC) administered during the CH bout period. Comorbid depression and anxiety were ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales. Headache impact was evaluated using the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6). Of 119 eligible patients, 48 and two (40.3% and 1.7%) had CA during and between headache attacks, respectively. In univariable analyses, total CH duration, major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were associated with CA during headache attack. They remained significantly associated with CA during headache attack in multivariable analyses. Patients with CA during headache attack had higher headache impact (P = 0.002). A “50% responder” analysis showed no difference in outcome of acute and preventive treatment between patients with and without CA during headache attack. Patients with CH commonly experienced CA during headache attack, but not between headache attacks.

{"abstract":"R-loops are DNA–RNA hybrids enriched at CpG islands (CGIs) that can regulate chromatin states1–8. How R-loops are recognized and interpreted by specific epigenetic readers is unknown. Here we show that GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45A) binds directly to R-loops and mediates local DNA demethylation by recruiting TET1 (ten-eleven translocation 1). Studying the tumor suppressor TCF21 (ref. 9), we find that antisense long noncoding (lncRNA) TARID (TCF21 antisense RNA inducing promoter demethylation) forms an R-loop at the TCF21 promoter. Binding of GADD45A to the R-loop triggers local DNA demethylation and TCF21 expression. TARID transcription, R-loop formation, DNA demethylation, and TCF21 expression proceed sequentially during the cell cycle. Oxidized DNA demethylation intermediates are enriched at genomic R-loops and their levels increase upon RNase H1 depletion. Genomic profiling in embryonic stem cells identifies thousands of R-loop-dependent TET1 binding sites at CGIs. We propose that GADD45A is an epigenetic R-loop reader that recruits the demethylation machinery to promoter CGIs. GADD45A directly binds to R-loops and mediates local DNA demethylation by recruiting TET1. lncRNA-mediated formation of R-loops at the promoter of the tumor suppressor TCF21 triggers GADD45A binding, demethylation and expression.","authors":"Khelifa Arab; Emil Karaulanov; Michael Musheev; Philipp Trnka; Andrea Schäfer; Ingrid Grummt; Christof Niehrs","keywords":"Epigenetics","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Division of Molecular Biology of the Cell II, German Cancer Research Center and DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Molecular Embryology, German Cancer Research Center and DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Division of Molecular Biology of the Cell II, German Cancer Research Center and DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Division of Molecular Embryology, German Cancer Research Center and DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany","title":"GADD45A binds R-loops and recruits TET1 to CpG island promoters","id":"e6fa2145-239f-4d8d-8ed1-46883551287a"}
{"abstract":"Melanoma is the most lethal cutaneous cancer. New drugs have recently appeared; however, not all patients obtain a benefit of these new drugs. For this reason, it is still necessary to characterize melanoma at molecular level. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular differences between melanoma tumor subtypes, based on BRAF and NRAS mutational status. Fourteen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanoma samples were analyzed using a high-throughput proteomics approach, combined with probabilistic graphical models and Flux Balance Analysis, to characterize these differences. Proteomics analyses showed differences in expression of proteins related with fatty acid metabolism, melanogenesis and extracellular space between BRAF mutated and BRAF non-mutated melanoma tumors. Additionally, probabilistic graphical models showed differences between melanoma subgroups at biological processes such as melanogenesis or metabolism. On the other hand, Flux Balance Analysis predicts a higher tumor growth rate in BRAF mutated melanoma samples. In conclusion, differential biological processes between melanomas showing a specific mutational status can be detected using combined proteomics and computational approaches.","authors":"Lucía Trilla-Fuertes; Angelo Gámez-Pozo; Guillermo Prado-Vázquez; Andrea Zapater-Moros; Mariana Díaz-Almirón; Claudia Fortes; María Ferrer-Gómez; Rocío López-Vacas; Verónica Parra Blanco; Iván Márquez-Rodas; Ainara Soria; Juan Ángel Fresno Vara; Enrique Espinosa","keywords":"Cancer; Computational models; Molecular medicine","organization_affiliated":"Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL, Madrid, Spain; Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL, Madrid, Spain; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL, Madrid, Spain; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL, Madrid, Spain; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Biostatistics Unit, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Functional Genomics Center Zurich, University of Zurich/ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Servicio de Anatomía Patológica, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain; Servicio de Oncología Médica, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain; Biomedical Research Networking Center on Oncology-CIBERONC, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Servicio de Oncología Médica, Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid, Spain; Molecular Oncology \u0026 Pathology Lab, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics-INGEMM, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Biomedical Research Networking Center on Oncology-CIBERONC, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Servicio de Oncología Médica, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain; Biomedical Research Networking Center on Oncology-CIBERONC, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain","title":"Melanoma proteomics suggests functional differences related to mutational status","id":"e0320119-6c59-4b10-b1ab-eca6edd92c46"}
{"abstract":"Noninvasive transcranial electric stimulation is increasingly being used as an advantageous therapy alternative that may activate deep tissues while avoiding drug side-effects. However, not only is there limited evidence for activation of deep tissues by transcranial electric stimulation, its evoked human sensation is understudied and often dismissed as a placebo or secondary effect. By systematically characterizing the human sensation evoked by transcranial alternating-current stimulation, we observed not only stimulus frequency and electrode position dependencies specific for auditory and visual sensation but also a broader presence of somatic sensation ranging from touch and vibration to pain and pressure. We found generally monotonic input-output functions at suprathreshold levels, and often multiple types of sensation occurring simultaneously in response to the same electric stimulation. We further used a recording circuit embedded in a cochlear implant to directly and objectively measure the amount of transcranial electric stimulation reaching the auditory nerve, a deep intercranial target located in the densest bone of the skull. We found an optimal configuration using an ear canal electrode and low-frequency (\u003c300 Hz) sinusoids that delivered maximally ~1% of the transcranial current to the auditory nerve, which was sufficient to produce sound sensation even in deafened ears. Our results suggest that frequency resonance due to neuronal intrinsic electric properties need to be explored for targeted deep brain stimulation and novel brain-computer interfaces.","authors":"Fan-Gang Zeng; Phillip Tran; Matthew Richardson; Shuping Sun; Yuchen Xu","keywords":"Sensory processing; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"Center for Hearing Research, Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Cognitive Sciences, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA; Center for Hearing Research, Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Cognitive Sciences, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA; Center for Hearing Research, Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Cognitive Sciences, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA; Center for Hearing Research, Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Cognitive Sciences, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA; Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Henan, China; Center for Hearing Research, Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Cognitive Sciences, Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Irvine, Irvine, USA; Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","title":"Human Sensation of Transcranial Electric Stimulation","id":"9bd2c1f5-2c06-46e8-9c29-7cbbdf0d6043"}
{"abstract":"The fur colour of American mink (Neovison vison) involves over 35 traits, but only three of these have been linked to specific genes. Despite being the most popular, coat colours Silverblue and Hedlund white remain uncharacterized genetically. The former is the first genetic mutant of fur colour identified in minks, while the latter is a commercially valuable phenotype that can be dyed easily. Here, we performed the whole genome sequencing for two American mink breeds with Silverblue and Hedlund white coats. We identified mutations in splice donor sites of genes coding melanophilin (MLPH) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) that regulate melanosome transport and neural-crest-derived melanocyte development, respectively. Both mutations cause mRNA splicing impairments that lead to a shift in open reading frames of MLPH and MITF. We conclude that our data should be useful for tracking economically valuable fur traits in mink breeding programs to contribute to global fur production.","authors":"Andrey D. Manakhov; Tatiana V.

{"abstract":"Oxidation can strongly influence the performance of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) by decreasing their conductivity. Here, we identify and investigate a way to prevent the oxidation process of CuNWs to maintain the high conducting performance of CuNWs as transparent electrodes. CuNWs were synthesised using an aqueous method. We prepared several temperature treatments (from 0–300 °C) to represent oxidation of CuNWs in different environments, to study the oxidation process and changes in morphology in detail. Depending on the temperature, smooth and uniform CuNWs exposed to oxidation produced rough Cu2O and CuO nanowires. We then suggest a method of protecting nanowires from oxidation, using the Mayer rod coating method to apply a layer of PEDOT:PSS to a transparent conducting film of CuNWs. The result indicates that this method of protection can protect the film, and maintain a stable, and constant resistance over of time, without effecting the excellent conductivity properties of pure CuNWs.","authors":"Dedi Mardiansyah; Trevon Badloe; Kuwat Triyana; Muhammad Q.

{"abstract":"Electronic nematicity is observed in a heavy-fermion superconductor, CeRhIn5, suggesting a close link between unconventional superconductivity and the appearance of nematicity. Several strongly correlated electron materials, such as iron pnictides, which were recently discovered to be high-temperature superconductors, have been found to harbour an unusual state: electronic nematicity. This state is characterized by a directional alignment of electronic structure against the rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice. An unresolved question is how this state connects to superconductivity. Philip Moll and colleagues present a unique set of measurements, directly observing anisotropy in the electrical resistivity of the heavy fermion superconductor CeRhIn5. The authors argue that electronic nematicity and superconductivity have a common origin, with nematicity emerging with increasing magnetic field and superconductivity with increasing pressure near the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition. This scenario opens up a fresh direction for investigating exotic states in correlated electron systems and suggests that nematic states in such systems may be more common than previously thought. Electronic nematic materials are characterized by a lowered symmetry of the electronic system compared to the underlying lattice, in analogy to the directional alignment without translational order in nematic liquid crystals1. Such nematic phases appear in the copper- and iron-based high-temperature superconductors2,3,4, and their role in establishing superconductivity remains an open question. Nematicity may take an active part, cooperating or competing with superconductivity, or may appear accidentally in such systems. Here we present experimental evidence for a phase of fluctuating nematic character in a heavy-fermion superconductor, CeRhIn5 (ref. 5). We observe a magnetic-field-induced state in the vicinity of a field-tuned antiferromagnetic quantum critical point at Hc ≈ 50 tesla. This phase appears above an out-of-plane critical field H* ≈ 28 tesla and is characterized by a substantial in-plane resistivity anisotropy in the presence of a small in-plane field component. The in-plane symmetry breaking has little apparent connection to the underlying lattice, as evidenced by the small magnitude of the magnetostriction anomaly at H*. Furthermore, no anomalies appear in the magnetic torque, suggesting the absence of metamagnetism in this field range. The appearance of nematic behaviour in a prototypical heavy-fermion superconductor highlights the interrelation of nematicity and unconventional superconductivity, suggesting nematicity to be common among correlated materials.","authors":"F.

{"abstract":"Starch is the main storage carbohydrate in plants and an important natural resource for food, feed and industrial raw materials. However, the details regarding the pathway for starch biosynthesis and the diversity of biosynthetic enzymes involved in this process are poorly understood. This study uses a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of 74 sequenced plant genomes to revisit the evolutionary history of the genes encoding ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase (SS), starch branching enzyme (SBE) and starch de-branching enzyme (DBE). Additionally, the protein structures and expression patterns of these four core genes in starch biosynthesis were studied to determine their functional differences. The results showed that AGPase, SS, SBE and DBE have undergone complicated evolutionary processes in plants and that gene/genome duplications are responsible for the observed differences in isoform numbers. A structure analysis of these proteins suggested that the deletion/mutation of amino acids in some active sites resulted in not only structural variation but also sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization. Expression profiling indicated that AGPase-, SS-, SBE- and DBE-encoding genes exhibit spatio-temporally divergent expression patterns related to the composition of functional complexes in starch biosynthesis. This study provides a comprehensive atlas of the starch biosynthetic pathway, and these data should support future studies aimed at increasing understanding of starch biosynthesis and the functional evolutionary divergence of AGPase, SS, SBE, and DBE in plants.","authors":"Jianzhou Qu; Shutu Xu; Zhengquan Zhang; Guangzhou Chen; Yuyue Zhong; Linsan Liu; Renhe Zhang; Jiquan Xue; Dongwei Guo","keywords":"Molecular evolution; Plant evolution","organization_affiliated":"The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China; The key Laboratory of Biology and Genetics Improvement of Maize in Arid Area of Northwest Region, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Agronomy, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; Maize Engineering Technology Research Centre of Shaanxi Province, Yangling, China","title":"Evolutionary, structural and expression analysis of core genes involved in starch synthesis","id":"e8e8b13b-63c3-4269-bacd-129b9778a1cc"}
{"abstract":"Altered expression of GABA receptors (GABAARs) has been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, but limited information about region-specific GABAAR subunit expression in healthy human brains, heteromeric assembly of major isoforms, and their collective organization across healthy individuals, are major roadblocks to understanding their role in non-physiological states. Here, by using microarray and RNA-Seq datasets—from single cell nuclei to global brain expression—from the Allen Institute, we find that transcriptional expression of GABAAR subunits is anatomically organized according to their neurodevelopmental origin. The data show a combination of complementary and mutually-exclusive expression patterns that delineate major isoforms, and which is highly stereotypical across brains from control donors. We summarize the region-specific signature of GABAR subunits per subject and its variability in a control population sample that can be used as a reference for remodeling changes during homeostatic rearrangements of GABAAR subunits after physiological, pharmacological or pathological challenges.

{"abstract":"Lead halide perovskites based microlasers have recently shown their potential in nanophotonics. However, up to now, all of the perovskite microlasers are static and cannot be dynamically tuned in use. Herein, we demonstrate a robust mechanism to realize the all-optical control of perovskite microlasers. In lead halide perovskite microrods, deterministic mode switching takes place as the external excitation is increased: the onset of a new lasing mode switches off the initial one via a negative power slope, while the main laser characteristics are well kept. This mode switching is reversible with the excitation and has been explained via cross-gain saturation. The modal interaction induced mode switching does not rely on sophisticated cavity designs and is generic in a series of microlasers. The switching time is faster than 70 ps, extending perovskite microlasers to previously inaccessible areas, e.g., optical memory, flip-flop, and ultrafast switches etc. Lead halide perovskite lasers have great potential as microscale organic light sources, but dynamic tuning has yet to be achieved. Here, Zhang, Fan et al. investigate how nonlinear modal interactions enable ultrafast mode switching with crossgain saturation.","authors":"Nan Zhang; Yubin Fan; Kaiyang Wang; Zhiyuan Gu; Yuhan Wang; Li Ge; Shumin Xiao; Qinghai Song","keywords":"Lasers, LEDs and light sources; Materials for optics; Nonlinear optics","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; The Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, USA; Department of Engineering Science and Physics, College of Staten Island, CUNY, Staten Island, USA; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China; State Key Laboratory on Tunable laser Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Key Lab of Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Information System, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China","title":"All-optical control of lead halide perovskite microlasers","id":"350b0b1e-435d-4831-85df-c820c99fe731"}
{"abstract":"The composition and structure of plant-root-associated fungal communities are determined by local abiotic and biotic conditions. However, the relative influence and identity of relationships to abiotic and biotic factors may differ across environmental and ecological contexts, and fungal functional groups. Thus, understanding which aspects of root-associated fungal community ecology generalise across contexts is the first step towards a more predictive framework. We investigated how the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors scale across environmental and ecological contexts using high-throughput sequencing (ca. 55 M Illumina metabarcoding sequences) of \u003e260 plant-root-associated fungal communities from six UK salt marshes across two geographic regions (South-East and North-West England) in winter and summer. Levels of root-associated fungal diversity were comparable with forests and temperate grasslands, quadrupling previous estimates of salt-marsh fungal diversity. Whilst abiotic variables were generally most important, a range of site- and spatial scale-specific abiotic and biotic drivers of diversity and community composition were observed. Consequently, predictive models of diversity trained on one site, extrapolated poorly to others. Fungal taxa from the same functional groups responded similarly to the specific drivers of diversity and composition. Thus site, spatial scale and functional group are key factors that, if accounted for, may lead to a more predictive understanding of fungal community ecology.","authors":"A.

{"abstract":"Previous studies suggested that hypertensive patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy display right ventricular (RV) remodelling. Few data are available about RV remodelling in naive hypertensives without severe cardiac organ damage. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between RV and LV morpho-functional parameters in never-treated patients with grade 1 hypertension and whether central blood pressure (CBP), inflammatory and metabolic parameters are potentially associated with RV remodelling. 150 never-treated subjects without evidence of diabetes or other cardiovascular diseases were enrolled in our study. We recruited 100 patients with mild hypertension (twenty-four hours blood pressure (24 h BP) ≥ 130/80 mmHg) and 50 normotensive subjects matched for gender, age and body mass index. To estimate the LV/RV parameters, we performed echography as well as arterial tonometry to assess pulse wave analysis/velocity (PWA/PWV). We found 24 h BP, CBP and PWV were higher in hypertensive patients than in normotensives. In addition, LV mass index was higher in hypertensives, and greater RV free wall thickness was observed (5.3 ± 1.4 vs 4.6 ± 1.2 mm, P = 0.02).

{"abstract":"While residential energy and ventilation standards aim to improve the energy performance and indoor air quality (IAQ) of homes, their combined impact across diverse residential activities and housing environments has not been well-established. This study demonstrates the insights that a recently-developed, freely-available coupled IAQ-energy modeling platform can provide regarding the energy and IAQ trade-offs of weatherization (i.e., sealing and insulation) and ventilation retrofits in multifamily housing across varied indoor occupant activity and mechanical ventilation scenarios in Boston, MA. Overall, it was found that combined weatherization and improved ventilation recommended by design standards could lead to both energy savings and IAQ-related benefits; however, ventilation standards may not be sufficient to protect against IAQ disbenefits for residents exposed to strong indoor sources (e.g., heavy cooking or smoking) and could lead to net increases in energy costs (e.g., due to the addition of continuous outdoor air ventilation). The modeling platform employed in this study is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of building typologies, retrofits, climates, and indoor occupant activities; therefore, it stands as a valuable tool for identifying cost-effective interventions that meet both energy efficiency and ventilation standards and improve IAQ across diverse housing populations.","authors":"Lindsay J.

{"abstract":"Parkinson’s disease, the most common age-related movement disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with unclear etiology. Better understanding of the underlying disease mechanism(s) is an urgent need for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics. Limited studies have been performed in large patient cohorts to identify protein alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a proximal site to pathology. We set out to identify disease-relevant protein changes in CSF to gain insights into the etiology of Parkinson’s disease and potentially assist in disease biomarker identification. In this study, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode to identify Parkinson’s-relevant biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. We quantified 341 protein groups in two independent cohorts (n = 196) and a longitudinal cohort (n = 105 samples, representing 40 patients) consisting of Parkinson’s disease and healthy control samples from three different sources. A first cohort of 53 Parkinson’s disease and 72 control samples was analyzed, identifying 53 proteins with significant changes (p \u003c 0.05) in Parkinson’s disease relative to healthy control. We established a biomarker signature and multiple protein ratios that differentiate Parkinson’s disease from healthy controls and validated these results in an independent cohort. The second cohort included 28 Parkinson’s disease and 43 control samples. Independent analysis of these samples identified 41 proteins with significant changes. Evaluation of the overlapping changes between the two cohorts identified 13 proteins with consistent and significant changes (p \u003c 0.05). Importantly, we found the extended granin family proteins as reduced in disease, suggesting a potential common mechanism for the biological reduction in monoamine neurotransmission in Parkinson’s patients. Our study identifies several novel protein changes in Parkinson’s disease cerebrospinal fluid that may be exploited for understanding etiology of disease and for biomarker development.","authors":"Melissa S.

{"abstract":"Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems are capable of detecting sounds that induce sub-nanometer vibrations of the hair bundle, below the stochastic noise levels of the surrounding fluid. Furthermore, the auditory system exhibits a highly rapid response time, in the sub-millisecond regime. We propose that chaotic dynamics enhance the sensitivity and temporal resolution of the hair bundle response, and we provide experimental and theoretical evidence for this effect. We use the Kolmogorov entropy to measure the degree of chaos in the system and the transfer entropy to quantify the amount of stimulus information captured by the detector. By varying the viscosity and ionic composition of the surrounding fluid, we are able to experimentally modulate the degree of chaos observed in the hair bundle dynamics in vitro. We consistently find that the hair bundle is most sensitive to a stimulus of small amplitude when it is poised in the weakly chaotic regime. Further, we show that the response time to a force step decreases with increasing levels of chaos. These results agree well with our numerical simulations of a chaotic Hopf oscillator and suggest that chaos may be responsible for the high sensitivity and rapid temporal response of hair cells.","authors":"Justin Faber; Dolores Bozovic","keywords":"Applied mathematics; Biological physics; Biophysics; Nonlinear phenomena","organization_affiliated":"Department of Physics \u0026 Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Physics \u0026 Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, USA","title":"Chaotic Dynamics Enhance the Sensitivity of Inner Ear Hair Cells","id":"68aad459-bf14-447d-abba-5e0ac4a36b85"}
{"abstract":"Guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) belongs to the interferons (IFNs) induced guanylate-binding protein family (Guanosine triphosphatases, GTPases) consisting of seven homologous members, termed GBP1 to GBP7. We used multidimensional survey ways to explore GBPs expression, regulation, mutations, immune infiltration and functional networks in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient data based on various open databases. The study provides staggered evidence for the significance of GBPs in HNSCC and its potential role as a novel biomarker. Our results showed that over expressions of 7 GBPs members and multivariate analysis suggested that N-stage, high expressions of GBP1 and low expression of GBP6/7 were linked to shorter OS in HNSCC patients. In addition, B cells of immune infiltrates stimulant the prognosis and might have a medical prognostic significance linked to GBPs in HNSCC. We assume that GBPs play a synergistic role in the viral related HNSCC. Our results show that data mining efficiently reveals information about GBPs expression in HNSCC and more importance lays a foundation for further research on the role of GBPs in cancers.","authors":"Zeng-Hong Wu; Fucheng Cai; Yi Zhong","keywords":"Diagnostic markers; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","title":"Comprehensive Analysis of the Expression and Prognosis for GBPs in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","id":"b103e5e6-df1b-42ae-b429-9ebf98beadbe"}
{"abstract":"Placebo responses in depression exemplify how expectancies and appraisals impact mood. Cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these responses are still poorly understood, partly due to the difficulty of simulating antidepressant effects and manipulating mood experimentally. To address these challenges, we developed an acute antidepressant placebo experiment involving the intravenous administration of a “fast-acting antidepressant” and a trial-by-trial sham fMRI “neurofeedback” manipulation, purporting to reveal mood-relevant neural responses. Twenty volunteers with major depression underwent this experiment while rating their expected and actual mood improvement. Mixed-effects analyses of trial-by-trial ratings revealed that the “drug” infusion cues induced higher expectancies of mood improvement, while both the “drug” infusion cue and the sham neurofeedback induced a reported mood improvement. Neurofeedback of greater magnitude, compared to lower magnitude, recruited the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Individuals with greater lPFC responses to neurofeedback displayed: (1) greater effect of previous mood improvement on expectancy ratings and (2) greater effect of sham neurofeedback on mood improvement. Behavioral antidepressant placebo effects were additionally moderated by changes in peripheral β-endorphin plasma levels and depressive symptomatology. These data demonstrate the feasibility of trial-by-trial manipulation of antidepressant placebo-associated expectancies and their reinforcement. We provide initial insights into the role of the lPFC in the interplay between placebo-induced expectancies and mood, as well as preliminary evidence for the role of the opioid system in antidepressant placebo effects.","authors":"M.

{"abstract":"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCH). In addition to the toxic effect of Bilirubin (BIL), it has antioxidant properties that were associated with the psychopathology and cognitive impairment of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of serum total BIL (TBIL) concentration with cognitive impairment in SCH patients. We recruited 34 SCH patients and 119 healthy controls (HCs) in this case-control design. Cognition was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Serum TBIL concentration was measured using the immunoturbidimetric method. Serum TBIL concentration was significantly decreased in SCH patients compared to HCs after adjusting for age, gender, and education. Serum TBIL concentration in SCH patients was also positively correlated with the RBANS immediate memory score. Further stepwise multiple regression analysis confirmed the positive association between serum TBIL concentration and immediate memory score in SCH patients. Our findings supported that the decline in serum TBIL concentration was associated with the immediate memory impairment and psychopathology of SCH.","authors":"Xiao Li Yin; Qiu Fang Jia; Guang Ya Zhang; Jian Ping Zhang; Tomoaki Shirao; Cai Xia Jiang; Xu Yuan Yin; Yan Song Liu; Peng Chen; Xiao Chu Gu; Zheng Kang Qian; Guang Zhong Yin; Hai Sen Xia; Li Hui","keywords":"Biological sciences; Predictive markers; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Wenzhou Kangning Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Suzhou Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Department of Psychiatry, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, East Garden City, USA; Division of Psychiatry Research, The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Mengcheng Brain Health Hospital, Anhui, China; Wenzhou Kangning Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Institute of Mental Health, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China; Suzhou Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Jiangsu, China","title":"Association between decreased serum TBIL concentration and immediate memory impairment in schizophrenia patients","id":"505b7d83-850e-430e-a73f-f592eb428816"}
{"abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a pivotal activator of angiogenesis and calcium (Ca2+) signaling in endothelial cells, was shown to increase collagen production in atrial fibroblasts. In this study, we evaluated whether VEGF may regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in atrial fibroblasts and contribute to its profibrogenesis. Migration, and proliferation analyses, patch-clamp assay, Ca2+ fluorescence imaging, and western blotting were performed using VEGF-treated (300 pg/mL or 1000 pg/mL) human atrial fibroblasts with or without coadministration of Ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid (EGTA, 1 mmol/L), or KN93 (a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II [CaMKII] inhibitor, 10 μmol/L). VEGF (1000 pg/mL) increased migration, myofibroblast differentiation, pro-collagen type I, pro-collagen type III production, and phosphorylated VEGF receptor 1 expression of fibroblasts. VEGF (1000 pg/mL) increased the nonselective cation current (INSC) of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and potassium current of intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa3.1) channels thereby upregulating Ca2+ entry. VEGF upregulated phosphorylated ERK expression. An ERK inhibitor (PD98059, 50 μmol/L) attenuated VEGF-activated INSC of TRP channels. The presence of EGTA attenuated the profibrotic effects of VEGF on pro-collagen type I, pro-collagen type III production, myofibroblast differentiation, and migratory capabilities of fibroblasts. VEGF upregulated the expression of phosphorylated CaMKII in fibroblasts, which was attenuated by EGTA. In addition, KN93 reduced VEGF-increased pro-collagen type I, pro-collagen type III production, myofibroblast differentiation, and the migratory capabilities of fibroblasts. In conclusion, we found that VEGF increases atrial fibroblast activity through CaMKII signaling by enhancing Ca2+ entry. Our findings provide benchside evidence leading to a potential novel strategy targeting atrial myopathy and arrhythmofibrosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor increases the profibrotic activity of atrial fibroblasts by activating the currents through transient receptor potential channels and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated K+ (KCa3.1) channels and by enhancing Ca2+ entry-induced phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling. These findings suggest a novel strategy targeting atrial myopathy and arrhythmofibrosis.","authors":"Cheng-Chih Chung; Yung-Kuo Lin; Yao-Chang Chen; Yu-Hsun Kao; Ting-I Lee; Yi-Jen Chen","keywords":"Atrial fibrillation; Calcium signalling; Heart failure","organization_affiliated":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of General Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Cardiovascular Research Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor enhances profibrotic activities through modulation of calcium homeostasis in human atrial fibroblasts","id":"2c756472-5034-477e-be9a-d9ee1387df37"}
{"abstract":"The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced new methodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics, the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation of information along social networks. More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola’s team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola’s game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola’s F.C.

{"abstract":"A detailed atomic-scale description of the electrochemical interface is essential to the understanding of electrochemical energy transformations. In this work, we investigate the charge of solvated protons at the Pt(111) | H2O and Al(111) | H2O interfaces. Using semi-local density-functional theory as well as hybrid functionals and embedded correlated wavefunction methods as higher-level benchmarks, we show that the effective charge of a solvated proton in the electrochemical double layer or outer Helmholtz plane at all levels of theory is fractional, when the solvated proton and solvent band edges are aligned correctly with the Fermi level of the metal (EF). The observed fractional charge in the absence of frontier band misalignment arises from a significant overlap between the proton and the electron density from the metal surface, and results in an energetic difference between protons in bulk solution and those in the outer Helmholtz plane. A detailed atomic-scale description of the electrochemical interface is essential to the understanding of electrochemical energy transformations. Here, the authors investigate the solvated proton at the electrochemical interface and show that it unexpectedly carries a fractional charge.","authors":"Leanne D. Chen; Michal Bajdich; J. Mark P.

{"abstract":"Maternal immune activation (MIA) disrupts the central innate immune system during a critical neurodevelopmental period. Microglia are primary innate immune cells in the brain although their direct influence on the MIA phenotype is largely unknown. Here we show that MIA alters microglial gene expression with upregulation of cellular protrusion/neuritogenic pathways, concurrently causing repetitive behavior, social deficits, and synaptic dysfunction to layer V intrinsically bursting pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of mice. MIA increases plastic dendritic spines of the intrinsically bursting neurons and their interaction with hyper-ramified microglia. Treating MIA offspring by colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitors induces depletion and repopulation of microglia, and corrects protein expression of the newly identified MIA-associated neuritogenic molecules in microglia, which coalesces with correction of MIA-associated synaptic, neurophysiological, and behavioral abnormalities. Our study demonstrates that maternal immune insults perturb microglial phenotypes and influence neuronal functions throughout adulthood, and reveals a potent effect of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitors on the correction of MIA-associated microglial, synaptic, and neurobehavioral dysfunctions.","authors":"Seiko Ikezu; Hana Yeh; Jean-Christophe Delpech; Maya E.

{"abstract":"In the present study we evaluated changes in neural activation that occur over the time course of multiple days of sensorimotor adaptation, and identified individual neural predictors of adaptation and savings magnitude. We collected functional MRI data while participants performed a manual adaptation task during four separate test sessions over a three-month period. This allowed us to examine changes in activation and associations with adaptation and savings at subsequent sessions. Participants exhibited reliable savings of adaptation across the four sessions. Brain activity associated with early adaptation increased across the sessions in a variety of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and temporal cortical areas, as well as various subcortical areas. We found that savings was positively associated with activation in several striatal, parietal, and cingulate cortical areas including the putamen, precuneus, angular gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and cingulate motor area. These findings suggest that participants may learn how to better engage cognitive processes across days, potentially reflecting improvements in action selection. We propose that such improvements may rely on action-value assignments, which previously have been linked to the dACC and striatum. As correct movements are assigned a higher value than incorrect movements, the former are more likely to be performed again.","authors":"M. F. L. Ruitenberg; V. Koppelmans; Y. E. De Dios; N. E.

{"abstract":"Sensing and uptake of external ammonium is essential for anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria, and is typically the domain of the ubiquitous Amt/Rh ammonium transporters. Here, we report on the structure and function of an ammonium sensor/transducer from the anammox bacterium “Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis” that combines a membrane-integral ammonium transporter domain with a fused histidine kinase. It contains a high-affinity ammonium binding site not present in assimilatory Amt proteins. The levels of phosphorylated histidine in the kinase are coupled to the presence of ammonium, as conformational changes during signal recognition by the Amt module are transduced internally to modulate the kinase activity. The structural analysis of this ammonium sensor by X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray-scattering reveals a flexible, bipartite system that recruits a large uptake transporter as a sensory module and modulates its functionality to achieve a mechanistic coupling to a kinase domain in order to trigger downstream signaling events. For anammox bacteria, the sensing and uptake of ammonium is essential and specialized proteins, like Ks-Amt5, mediate such processes. Here, authors perform biophysical, biochemical, and structural analysis on Ks-Amt5 and establish a role for this protein as an ammonium-sensing signal transducer.","authors":"Tobias Pflüger; Camila F.

The primary outcome included urine oxidative stress biomarkers 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-isoprostane and plasma inflammatory biomarkers measured at 10, 18, and 26 weeks and averaged within individual. Linear and logistic regression models were used, adjusting for age, race, parity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. Among 462 women, 8-isoprostane was higher among depressed women (geometric mean: 299.96 pg/mL vs. 237.01 pg/mL; p = 0.001). In multivariable analyses, antenatal depression was significantly associated with an increase in average 8-isoprostane (β: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.05–0.44; p = 0.01). The association of antenatal depression with SPTB was partially mediated by 8-isoprostane. Antenatal depression was not associated with 8-OHdG or inflammatory biomarkers. Antenatal depression was associated with higher oxidative stress across pregnancy, namely 8-isoprostane, and may impact SPTB via oxidative stress.","authors":"Kartik K. Venkatesh; John D.

{"abstract":"Removal of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] from soils and water has been widely studied for its high toxicity. Although leaching method is viewed as an effective approach to eliminate Cr(VI) and some studies attempted to enhance leaching performance via the external electric field, there is little knowledge about the influential factor in electro-leaching system on Cr(VI) removal performance. In this study, an electro-leaching technology was developed for removing Cr(VI) from groundwater aquifer to comprehensively discuss the correlation between the operational parameters and Cr(VI) removal efficiency. When the applied voltage was 20 V and the initial Cr(VI) concentration was 40 mg/kg, Cr(VI) removal efficiency achieved 99.9% in 120 min in the electro-leaching system, 15% higher than the system without the electric field. Cr(VI) removal efficiencies increased with the voltage demonstrating the significant enhancement of the electro-leaching method in removing Cr(VI). When Cr(VI) concentration climbed to 120 mg/kg, Cr(VI) removal efficiency remained above 85%. The effects of different voltages, Cr(VI) concentrations, pollutant distribution and salt content of leaching solution on the leaching effect were also investigated. Meanwhile, the relationship between the current intensity change and the amount of removed Cr(VI) during the electro-leaching process was first investigated, and the relevant model was fitted. There is a quadratic linear correlation between the amount of current change and the amount of removed Cr(VI). This novel electro-enhanced leaching method can effectively remove Cr(VI) from contaminated groundwater aquifer by enhancing the migration of charged contaminant ions during the leaching process, and it is worthy of further study of heavy metal remediation.","authors":"Liyang Hu; Tingting Zhang; Dayi Zhang; Mengyun Jiang; Jie Tan; Jie Li; Zuhong Lin; Zetang Li","keywords":"Environmental impact; Pollution remediation","organization_affiliated":"College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; College of Chemical Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, People’s Republic of China","title":"Electro-enhanced leaching method for the mobilization of Cr(VI) in contaminated groundwater aquifer","id":"2bd2cad6-a7d7-46b6-94e4-a3d4d39efc6c"}
{"abstract":"Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data are emergingly used in the clinic e.g. for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In contrast to conventional MR imaging data, multiparametric data typically include functional measurements such as diffusion and perfusion imaging sequences. Conventionally, these measurements are visualized with a one-dimensional color scale, allowing only for one-dimensional information to be encoded. Yet, human perception places visual information in a three-dimensional color space. In theory, each dimension of this space can be utilized to encode visual information. We addressed this issue and developed a new method for tri-variate color-coded visualization of mpMRI data sets. We showed the usefulness of our method in a preclinical and in a clinical setting: In imaging data of a rat model of acute kidney injury, the method yielded characteristic visual patterns. In a clinical data set of N = 13 prostate cancer mpMRI data, we assessed diagnostic performance in a blinded study with N = 5 observers. Compared to conventional radiological evaluation, color-coded visualization was comparable in terms of positive and negative predictive values. Thus, we showed that human observers can successfully make use of the novel method. This method can be broadly applied to visualize different types of multivariate MRI data.","authors":"Jakob Nikolas Kather; Anja Weidner; Ulrike Attenberger; Yannick Bukschat; Cleo-Aron Weis; Meike Weis; Lothar R.

{"abstract":"Individuals who have lost normal pathways for communication need augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. In this study, we propose a new electrooculogram (EOG)-based human-computer interface (HCI) paradigm for AAC that does not require a user’s voluntary eye movement for binary yes/no communication by patients in locked-in state (LIS). The proposed HCI uses a horizontal EOG elicited by involuntary auditory oculogyric reflex, in response to a rotating sound source. In the proposed HCI paradigm, a user was asked to selectively attend to one of two sound sources rotating in directions opposite to each other, based on the user’s intention. The user’s intentions could then be recognised by quantifying EOGs. To validate its performance, a series of experiments was conducted with ten healthy subjects, and two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The online experimental results exhibited high-classification accuracies of 94% in both healthy subjects and ALS patients in cases where decisions were made every six seconds. The ALS patients also participated in a practical yes/no communication experiment with 26 or 30 questions with known answers. The accuracy of the experiments with questionnaires was 94%, demonstrating that our paradigm could constitute an auxiliary AAC system for some LIS patients.","authors":"Do Yeon Kim; Chang-Hee Han; Chang-Hwan Im","keywords":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Biomedical engineering","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"Development of an electrooculogram-based human-computer interface using involuntary eye movement by spatially rotating sound for communication of locked-in patients","id":"e1f29ecd-dc0e-4d00-a377-efdfe17978f2"}
{"abstract":"To evaluate the effect of low-temperature stress in winter wheat during the early growth stages, the response regularity of the canopy spectral reflectance was evaluated. Besides, winter wheat yield during the maturation stage and the relationship between yield and canopy spectral reflectance were also analyzed. Two multivariate methods, namely, the successive projections algorithm (SPA) and multiple linear regression (MLR), were combined to explore the relationship between the spectral reflectance and yield. Our results showed that the green peak and red valley in visible wavelengths altered obviously and the red edge gradually moved towards blue wavebands. The canopy spectral reflectance in the near-infrared wavebands increased with an increase in low-temperature stress intensity. Moreover, the reflectance proved that the red edge region under low-temperature stress is related to winter wheat yield, and approximately 38% of extracted wavebands were concentrated in the red edge region (680–780 nm). Compared with the predictive MLR models, the model calibrated during the flowering period of winter wheat (25 days post low-temperature treatment) had better performance in predicting crop yield. Whole-spectrum predictive models based on the principle component regression (PCR) method and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) models based on MLR were also established. Moreover, the performance of three kinds of calibration methods and the validation result of the field test were compared to select the optimal monitoring stage and technique to estimate the yield in the early growth stage of winter wheat under low-temperature stress. This study could provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for hyperspectral assessment of yield in winter wheat during low-temperature stress.","authors":"Yongkai Xie; Chao Wang; Wude Yang; Meichen Feng; Xingxing Qiao; Jinyao Song","keywords":"Climate and Earth system modelling; Environmental impact","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China; Institute of Dry Farming Engineering, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China","title":"Canopy hyperspectral characteristics and yield estimation of winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) under low temperature injury","id":"66aa3b17-170f-4ff9-b01c-ef7dcd4fa441"}
{"abstract":"The ocean is the main source of thermal inertia in the climate system1. During recent decades, ocean heat uptake has been quantified by using hydrographic temperature measurements and data from the Argo float program, which expanded its coverage after 20072,3. However, these estimates all use the same imperfect ocean dataset and share additional uncertainties resulting from sparse coverage, especially before 20074,5. Here we provide an independent estimate by using measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2)—levels of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases—as a whole-ocean thermometer. We show that the ocean gained 1.33 ± 0.20  × 1022 joules of heat per year between 1991 and 2016, equivalent to a planetary energy imbalance of 0.83 ± 0.11 watts per square metre of Earth’s surface. We also find that the ocean-warming effect that led to the outgassing of O2 and CO2 can be isolated from the direct effects of anthropogenic emissions and CO2 sinks. Our result—which relies on high-precision O2 measurements dating back to 19916—suggests that ocean warming is at the high end of previous estimates, with implications for policy-relevant measurements of the Earth response to climate change, such as climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases7 and the thermal component of sea-level rise8. An independent estimate based on atmospheric O2 and CO2 measurements suggests that global oceans absorbed about 0.83 watts per square metre of heat over the past three decades—at the high end of previous estimates.","authors":"L.

{"abstract":"Adipose tissue plays a major role in regulating whole-body insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism. To accommodate surplus energy, the tissue rapidly expands by increasing adipose cell size (hypertrophy) and cell number (hyperplasia). Previous studies have shown that enlarged, hypertrophic adipocytes are less responsive to insulin, and that adipocyte size could serve as a predictor for the development of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrate that changes in adipocyte size correlate with a drastic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Expansion of primary adipocytes following 2 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding in C57BL6/J mice was associated with a drastic increase in filamentous (F)-actin as assessed by fluorescence microscopy, increased Rho-kinase activity, and changed expression of actin-regulating proteins, favoring actin polymerization. At the same time, increased cell size was associated with impaired insulin response, while the interaction between the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein IQGAP1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 remained intact. Reversed feeding from HFD to chow restored cell size, insulin response, expression of actin-regulatory proteins and decreased the amount of F-actin filaments. Together, we report a drastic cytoskeletal remodeling during adipocyte expansion, a process which could contribute to deteriorating adipocyte function.","authors":"Björn Hansson; Björn Morén; Claes Fryklund; Lars Vliex; Sebastian Wasserstrom; Sebastian Albinsson; Karin Berger; Karin G.

{"abstract":"The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders. Sanna Vattulainen-Collanus et al. report that mutations in the BMPR2 gene, which is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension, result in a deficit of RAD51 and altered DNA repair and replication.

In addition, elevated HOXB9 predicts a poor prognosis in endometrial cancer patients. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis of TCGA cancer database showed that HOXB9 expression is positively correlated with E2F3 expression. Moreover, HOXB9 promoted E2F3 expression by directly targeting to its promoter. Furthermore, we found that knocking down E2F3 abolished the ability of HOXB9 in enhancing cell migration.

{"abstract":"Riparian plant diversity in arid regions is sensitive to changes in groundwater. Although it is well known that groundwater has a significant influence on plant diversity, there have been few studies on how groundwater and soil salinity impact plant community in desert riparian ecosystems. Therefore, we surveyed 77 quadrats (100 m × 100 m) to examine the relationship between groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, soil salinity and plant community in the upper reaches of the Tarim River. Data were analyzed with two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results indicated that Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, and Phragmites australis were the dominant plants among trees, shrubs and herbs, respectively. Five plant community types were classified. There were significant differences in species diversity, soil moisture, soil salinity, groundwater depth and groundwater salinity across the community types. The composition and distribution of plant community are significantly influenced by groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, soil moisture, distances from the river to the quadrats, soil pH, electrical conductivity, total salt, CO32−, Cl−, SO42−, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. Shallow groundwater depth, low groundwater salinity, and high soil moisture and soil salinity were associated with higher plant diversity.","authors":"Yong Zeng; Chengyi Zhao; Fengzhi Shi; Michael Schneider; Guanghui Lv; Yan Li","keywords":"Restoration ecology; Riparian ecology","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; Earth Sciences, Freie Universität Berlin (FUB), Berlin, Germany; College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China; State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China","title":"Impact of groundwater depth and soil salinity on riparian plant diversity and distribution in an arid area of China","id":"dd337ec5-8606-4ee5-a5ec-f78a186638b9"}

{"abstract":"Hybridization of quantum science and technology crucially depends on quantum gates between various physical systems. The different platforms have different fundamental physics and, therefore, diverse advantages in various applications. Many applications require nearly ideal quantum gates with variable large interaction gain and sufficient entangling power. Moreover, pulsed gates are advantageous for fast quantum circuits. For quantum systems with continuous variables, the quantum non-demolition (QND) gate is the most basic. It is an entangling gate that simultaneously keeps a variable of the interacting system unchanged. This feature is useful for quantum circuits from quantum sensing to continuous variable quantum computing. Currently, atomic ensembles storing quantum states of radiation and mechanical oscillators transducing them are two major but very different continuous-variable matter platforms. We propose a high-quality continuous-variable QND gate between an atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator in the separated optical cavities connected by propagating optical pulses. We demonstrate that squeezing of light pulses, homodyne measurement, and optimized feedforward control used to build the gate are sufficient to reach an interaction gain up to 50 with nearly ideal entangling power.","authors":"A.

{"abstract":"We developed a poly(vinylidene fluoride)/carbon nanotube (PVDF-MWCNT) filament as a feed for printing of electrically-conductive and corrosion-resistant functional material by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Using an environment-friendly procedure to fabricate PVDF-MWCNT filament, we achieved the best reported electrical conductivity of printable PVDF-MWCNT filament of 28.5 S cm−1 (90 wt% PVDF and 10 wt% CNT). The PVDF-MWCNT filaments are chemically stable in acid, base, and salt solution, with no significant changes in electrical conductivity and mass of the filaments. Our processing method is robust and allow a uniform mixture of PVDF and CNT with a wide range of CNT percentage up to 99.9%. We demonstrated the printing of PVDF-MWCNT filaments to create 3D shapes; printed using a low-cost commercial consumer-grade FFF 3D printer. We found many adjustments of printer parameters are needed to print filament with CNT content \u003e10 wt%, but easier printing for CNT content ≤10 wt%. Since this was due to printer limitation, we believed that PVDF-MWCNT with higher CNT percentage (to a certain limit) and larger electrical conductivity could be printed with a custom-built printer (for example stronger motor). PVDF-MWCNT filament shows higher electrical conductivity (28.5 S cm−1) than compressed composite (8.8 S cm−1) of the same 10 wt% of CNT, due to more alignment of CNT in the longitudinal direction of the extruded filament. Printable PVDF-MWCNT-Fe2O3 (with a functional additive of Fe2O3) showed higher electrical conductivity in the longitudinal direction at the filament core (42 S cm−1) compared to that in the longitudinal direction at the filament shell (0.43 S cm−1) for sample with composition of 60 wt% PVDF, 20 wt% CNT, and 20 wt% Fe2O3, due to extrusion skin effect with segregation of electrically insulating Fe2O3 at the shell surface of PVDF-MWCNT-Fe2O3.","authors":"Asma Almazrouei; Rahmat Agung Susantyoko; Chieh-Han Wu; Ibrahim Mustafa; Ayoob Alhammadi; Saif Almheiri","keywords":"Electronic properties and materials; Materials science","organization_affiliated":"Engineering Systems and Management, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Masdar Institute, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, Dubai Electricity \u0026 Water Authority (DEWA), Dubai, United Arab Emirates","title":"Robust Surface-Engineered Tape-Cast and Extrusion Methods to Fabricate Electrically-Conductive Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/Carbon Nanotube Filaments for Corrosion-Resistant 3D Printing Applications","id":"ac8b432d-0497-4096-b782-394d7048e5a3"}
{"abstract":"We examine the influence of superconductivity on the magneto-transport properties of a ferromagnetic Ni nanowire connected to Nb electrodes. We show experimentally and confirm theoretically that the Nb/Ni interface plays an essential role in the electron transport through the device. Just below the superconducting transition, a strong inverse proximity effect from the nanowire suppresses superconducting correlations at Nb/Ni interfaces, resulting in a conventional anisotropic magneto-resistive response. At lower temperatures however, the Nb electrodes operate as superconducting shunts. As the result, the magneto-resistance exhibits a strongly growing hysteretic behavior accompanied by a series of saw-like jumps. The latter are associated with the penetration/escape of individual Abrikosov vortices that influence non-equilibrium processes at the Nb/Ni interface. These effects should be taken into account when designing superconducting quantum nano-hybrids involving ferromagnetic nanowires.","authors":"O. V. Skryabina; S. N. Kozlov; S. V. Egorov; A. A.

The presence of 5q, 7q, and/or 17p abnormalities denotes typical CK and their absence denotes atypical CK. Since molecular features of CK-AML are not well characterized, we investigated mutational status of 81 leukemia/cancer-associated genes in 160 clinically well-characterized patients. They included 136 patients with ≥ 3 exclusively unbalanced chromosome abnormalities, 96 of whom had a typical CK and 40 atypical CK, and 24 patients with ≥ 1 balanced abnormality in addition to ≥ 2 unbalanced ones. Patients with atypical CK-AML differed from those with typical CK-AML: they carried TP53 mutations less often (P \u003c 0.001) and more often PHF6 (P = 0.008), FLT3-TKD (P = 0.02), MED12 (P = 0.02), and NPM1 (P = 0.02) mutations. They were younger (P = 0.007), had higher WBC (P = 0.001) and percentages of marrow (P \u003c 0.001) and blood (P = 0.006) blasts, higher complete remission rates (P = 0.02), and longer overall survival (P \u003c 0.001), thus indicating that atypical and typical CK-AMLs constitute distinct disease subtypes. We also identified smaller patient subsets within both typical and atypical CK-AML that differed molecularly and clinically.","authors":"Krzysztof Mrózek; Ann-Kathrin Eisfeld; Jessica Kohlschmidt; Andrew J.

{"abstract":"Epidermal electronic systems feature physical properties that approximate those of the skin, to enable intimate, long-lived skin interfaces for physiological measurements, human–machine interfaces and other applications that cannot be addressed by wearable hardware that is commercially available today. A primary challenge is power supply; the physical bulk, large mass and high mechanical modulus associated with conventional battery technologies can hinder efforts to achieve epidermal characteristics, and near-field power transfer schemes offer only a limited operating distance. Here we introduce an epidermal, far-field radio frequency (RF) power harvester built using a modularized collection of ultrathin antennas, rectifiers and voltage doublers. These components, separately fabricated and tested, can be integrated together via methods involving soft contact lamination. Systematic studies of the individual components and the overall performance in various dielectric environments highlight the key operational features of these systems and strategies for their optimization. The results suggest robust capabilities for battery-free RF power, with relevance to many emerging epidermal technologies. Battery-free devices that have skin-like properties can be realized using a soft laminating strategy. Small, wearable sensors that monitor health offer opportunities for improving personalized care, but powering these systems remains a challenge. Instead of applying rigid batteries, John Rogers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his colleagues from the United States and China developed a wearable device that captures far-field radio frequency (RF) power from sources such as cell-phone signals. Biological tissues have changeable dielectric properties that make it tricky to optimize RF energy harvesting. Switching from typical monolithic fabrications to a modularized approach in which components such as ultrathin antennas and voltage doublers are produced and tested separately proved successful. To avoid damaging their elastomeric substrates, the team laminated components together with soft wetting techniques and cold welding of gold electrodes.","authors":"Xian Huang; Yuhao Liu; Gil Woo Kong; Jung Hun Seo; Yinji Ma; Kyung-In Jang; Jonathan A.

{"abstract":"Promoting a healthy intestinal microbiota may have positive effects on short- and long-term outcomes in very low birth weight (VLBW; BW \u003c 1500 g) infants. Nutrient supply influences the intestinal microbiota. Fifty VLBW infants were randomized to an intervention group receiving enhanced nutrient supply or a control group. Fecal samples from 45 infants collected between birth and discharge were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing. There was considerable individual variation in microbiota development. Microbial richness decreased towards discharge in the controls compared to the intervention group. In the intervention group, there was a greater increase in diversity among moderately/very preterm (MVP, gestational age ≥ 28 weeks) infants and a steeper decrease in relative Staphylococcus abundance in extremely preterm (EP, gestational age \u003c 28 weeks) infants as compared to controls. Relative Bifidobacterium abundance tended to increase more in MVP controls compared to the intervention group. Abundance of pathogens was not increased in the intervention group. Higher relative Bifidobacterium abundance was associated with improved weight gain. Nutrition may affect richness, diversity, and microbiota composition. There was no increase in relative abundance of pathogens among infants receiving enhanced nutrient supply. Favorable microbiota development was associated with improved weight gain.","authors":"Elin W. Blakstad; Katri Korpela; Sindre Lee; Britt Nakstad; Sissel J. Moltu; Kenneth Strømmen; Arild E.

{"abstract":"Structural neuroimaging studies suggest altered brain maturation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with typically developing controls (TDC). However, the prognostic value of whole-brain structural connectivity analysis in ASD has not been established. Diffusion magnetic imaging data were acquired in 27 high-functioning young ASD participants (2 females) and 29 age-matched TDC (12 females; age 8–18 years) at baseline and again following 3–7 years. Whole-brain structural connectomes were reconstructed from these data and analyzed using a longitudinal statistical model. We identified distinct patterns of widespread brain connections that exhibited either significant increases or decreases in connectivity over time (p \u003c 0.001). There was a significant interaction between diagnosis and time in brain development (p \u003c 0.001). This was expressed by a decrease in structural connectivity within the frontoparietal network—and its broader connectivity—in ASD during adolescence and early adulthood. Conversely, these connections increased with time in TDC. Crucially, stronger baseline connectivity in this subnetwork predicted a lower symptom load at follow-up (p = 0.048), independent of the expression of symptoms at baseline. Our findings suggest a clinically meaningful relationship between the atypical development of frontoparietal structural connections and the dynamics of the autism phenotype through early adulthood. These results highlight a potential marker of future outcome.","authors":"Hsiang-Yuan Lin; Alistair Perry; Luca Cocchi; James A.

{"abstract":"In language comprehension, a variety of contextual cues act in unison to render upcoming words more or less predictable. As a sentence unfolds, we use prior context (sentential constraints) to predict what the next words might be. Additionally, in a conversation, we can predict upcoming sounds through observing the mouth movements of a speaker (visual constraints). In electrophysiological studies, effects of visual constraints have typically been observed early in language processing, while effects of sentential constraints have typically been observed later. We hypothesized that the visual and the sentential constraints might feed into the same predictive process such that effects of sentential constraints might also be detectable early in language processing through modulations of the early effects of visual salience. We presented participants with audiovisual speech while recording their brain activity with magnetoencephalography. Participants saw videos of a person saying sentences where the last word was either sententially constrained or not, and began with a salient or non-salient mouth movement. We found that sentential constraints indeed exerted an early (N1) influence on language processing. Sentential modulations of the N1 visual predictability effect were visible in brain areas associated with semantic processing, and were differently expressed in the two hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, visual and sentential constraints jointly suppressed the auditory evoked field, while the right hemisphere was sensitive to visual constraints only in the absence of strong sentential constraints. These results suggest that sentential and visual constraints can jointly influence even very early stages of audiovisual speech comprehension.","authors":"Heidi Solberg Økland; Ana Todorović; Claudia S.

{"abstract":"Microbial fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass to produce industrial chemicals is exacerbated by the recalcitrant network of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses comprising the plant secondary cell wall. In this study, we show that transgenic poplar (Populus trichocarpa) lines can be solubilized without any pretreatment by the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor bescii that has been metabolically engineered to shift its fermentation products away from inhibitory organic acids to ethanol. Carbohydrate solubilization and conversion of unpretreated milled biomass is nearly 90% for two transgenic lines, compared to only 25% for wild-type poplar. Unexpectedly, unpretreated intact poplar stems achieved nearly 70% of the fermentation production observed with milled poplar as the substrate. The nearly quantitative microbial conversion of the carbohydrate content of unpretreated transgenic lignocellulosic biomass bodes well for full utilization of renewable biomass feedstocks. Metabolizing lignocellulosic feedstocks to industrial chemicals by microorganisms requires surmounting  the recalcitrance caused by lignin. Here, the authors pair transgenic lignin modified poplar lines with engineered Caldicellusiruptor bescii to achieve biomass solubilization and ethanol conversion without pretreatment.","authors":"Christopher T.

{"abstract":"Human epithelial cells can be infected by more than 200 types of human papilloma viruses (HPVs), and persistent HPV infections lead to cervical cancer or other deadly cancers. It has been established that mitotic progression is critical for HPV16 infection, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that oncoprotein E7 of HPV16 but not HPV18 retards mitotic progression in host cell by direct binding to the C terminus of Microtubule-Associated Protein 4 (MAP4). MAP4 is a novel bona fide target of HPV16E7 protein which binds and recruits the latter to spindle microtubule in mitosis. HPV16E7 protein promotes MAP4 stability by inhibiting MAP4 phosphorylation- mediated degradation to increase the stability of microtubule polymerization and cause an extend mitotic progression. We further uncovered that Mps1 is a kinase of MAP4, and E7-MAP4 binding blocks Mps1 phosphorylation of MAP4, thereby interrupting phosphorylation-dependent MAP4 degradation. Mutations of MAP4 at T927ES928E partially abolished E7-binding capacity and rescued mitotic progression in host cells. In conclusion, our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which HPV16E7 perturbs host mitotic progression by interfering Mps1-MAP4 signaling cascade, which results in an extended infection window and may facilitate the persistent HPV16 infection.","authors":"Yu Guo; Xiaojuan Zhang; Quanbin Xu; Fuxing Gong; Xiaoqian Shi; Chaokun Li; Rui Huang; Fangyuan Nie; Wen Zhu; Jiujie Li; Junbo Tang; Runting Li; Limeng Zhang; Longxin Chen; Runlin Z.

{"abstract":"Huanglongbing (HLB) is a disease that has devastated the Florida citrus industry, threatens the entire U.S. citrus industry, and globally is rapidly spreading. Florida’s citrus production is 90% sweet orange, which is quite sensitive to HLB. The heavy reliance on sweet orange for Florida citrus production makes the industry especially vulnerable to diseases that are damaging to this type of citrus. Furthermore, 90% of Florida oranges are used in producing orange juice that is defined by a federal regulation known as the “orange juice standard”, specifying that at least 90% of “orange juice” must be derived from Citrus sinensis. Genomic analyses definitively reveal that sweet orange is not a true species, but just one of many introgression hybrids of C. reticulata and C. maxima, with phenotypic diversity resulting from accumulated mutations in this single hybrid, the “sweet orange”. No other fruit industry is limited by law to such a narrow genetic base. Fortunately, there are new citrus hybrids displaying reduced sensitivity to HLB, and in some cases they produce juice, alone or in blends, that consumers would recognize as “orange juice”. Reconsidering current regulations on orange juice standards may permit use of such hybrids in “orange juice”, providing greater latitude for commercialization of these hybrids, leading to higher-quality orange juice and a more sustainable Florida orange juice industry.","authors":"Ed Stover; Frederick G.

{"abstract":"As a childhood-onset psychiatric disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is complicated by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Lifelong executive function deficits in ADHD are described in many literatures and have been proposed as endophenotypes of ADHD. However, its genetic basis is still elusive. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study of executive function, rated with Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), in ADHD children. We identified one significant variant (rs852004, P = 2.51e-08) for the overall score of BRIEF. The association analyses for each component of executive function found this locus was more associated with inhibit and monitor components. Further principle component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided an ADHD-specific executive function pattern including inhibit and monitor factors. SNP rs852004 was mainly associated with the Behavioral Regulation factor. Meanwhile, we found the significant locus was associated with ADHD symptom. The Behavioral Regulation factor mediated its effect on ADHD symptom. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses further showed evidence that this variant affected the activity of inhibition control related brain regions. It provided new insights for the genetic basis of executive function in ADHD.","authors":"Xiao Sun; Zhaomin Wu; Qingjiu Cao; Ying Qian; Yong Liu; Binrang Yang; Suhua Chang; Li Yang; Yufeng Wang","keywords":"ADHD; Cognitive control; Genome-wide association studies","organization_affiliated":"Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders \u0026 Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China; Shenzhen Children’s Hospital, Shenzhen, China; Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders \u0026 Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China; Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders \u0026 Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China; College of Life Sciences and Bioengineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China; Shenzhen Children’s Hospital, Shenzhen, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China; Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders \u0026 Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China; Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders \u0026 Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China","title":"Genetic variant for behavioral regulation factor of executive function and its possible brain mechanism in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","id":"f6b5d3ab-e58c-4268-80b4-647e490581fc"}
{"abstract":"The number of colon cancer cases is increasing worldwide, and type II diabetes patients have an increased risk of developing colon cancer. Diet-borne advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may promote neoplastic transformation; however, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. The present study helped to define the relationship between dietary AGEs and cancer progression. C2BBe1 adenocarcinoma enterocytes were exposed to 200 µg/mL glycated casein (AGEs-Csn) for up to 24 h. AGEs-Csn exposure resulted in increased cell proliferation, maladaptative changes in SOD and CAT activity and moderate levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) intracellular accumulation. AGEs-Csn activated pro-survival and proliferation signalling, such as the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448) and Akt (Ser473). GSK-3β phosphorylation also increased, potentially inducing extracellular matrix remodelling and thus enabling metastasis. Moreover, AGEs-Csn induced MMP-1, -3, -7, -9 and -10 expression and activated MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are regulators of the extracellular matrix and cytokine functions. AGEs-Csn induced inflammatory responses that included extracellular IL-1β at 6 h; time-dependent increases in IL-8; RAGE and NF-κB p65 upregulation; and IκB inhibition. Co-treatment with anti-RAGE or anti-TNF-α blocking antibodies and AGEs-Csn partially counteracted these changes; however, IL-8, MMP-1 and -10 expression and MMP-9 activation were difficult to prevent.

{"abstract":"αMβ2 integrin (complement receptor 3) is a major receptor for phagocytosis in macrophages. In other contexts, integrins’ activities and functions are mechanically linked to actin dynamics through focal adhesions. We asked whether mechanical coupling of αMβ2 integrin to the actin cytoskeleton mediates phagocytosis. We found that particle internalization was driven by formation of Arp2/3 and formin-dependent actin protrusions that wrapped around the particle. Focal complex-like adhesions formed in the phagocytic cup that contained β2 integrins, focal adhesion proteins and tyrosine kinases. Perturbation of talin and Syk demonstrated that a talin-dependent link between integrin and actin and Syk-mediated recruitment of vinculin enable force transmission to target particles and promote phagocytosis. Altering target mechanical properties demonstrated more efficient phagocytosis of stiffer targets. Thus, macrophages use tyrosine kinase signalling to build a mechanosensitive, talin- and vinculin-mediated, focal adhesion-like molecular clutch, which couples integrins to cytoskeletal forces to drive particle engulfment. Jaumouillé et al. show that a talin/vinculin-based molecular clutch mechanically couples the forces generated by Arp2/3- and Dia1-mediated actin polymerization to promote integrin-mediated phagosome formation.","authors":"Valentin Jaumouillé; Alexander X.

{"abstract":"Guided bone regeneration (GBR) often utilizes a combination of autologous bone grafts, deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM), and collagen membranes. DBBM and collagen membranes pre-coated with bone-conditioned medium (BCM) extracted from locally harvested autologous bone chips have shown great regenerative potential in GBR. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the composition of BCM and its activity on the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells. We detected a fast and significant (P \u003c 0.001) release of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) from autologous bone within 10 min versus a delayed bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) release from 40 min onwards. BCMs harvested within short time periods (10, 20, or 40 min), corresponding to the time of a typical surgical procedure, significantly increased the proliferative activity and collagen matrix production of BCM-treated cells. Long-term (1, 3, or 6 days)-extracted BCMs promoted the later stages of osteoblast differentiation and maturation. Short-term-extracted BCMs, in which TGF-β1 but no BMP-2 was detected, reduced the expression of the late differentiation marker osteocalcin. However, when both growth factors were present simultaneously in the BCM, no inhibitory effects on osteoblast differentiation were observed, suggesting a synergistic TGF-β1/BMP-2 activity. Consequently, in cells that were co-stimulated with recombinant TGF-β1 and BMP-2, we showed a significant stimulatory and dose-dependent effect of TGF-β1 on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation due to prolonged BMP signaling and reduced expression of the BMP-2 antagonist noggin. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the favorable outcome from GBR procedures using BCM, derived from autologous bone grafts. ‘Bone-conditioned medium’ could improve oral bone regeneration therapy by promoting the proliferation and maturation of bone-forming cells. Building on recent research demonstrating the benefits of using cell culture medium prepared with bone chips (BCM) in such treatments, researchers led by Maria Asparuhova of the University of Bern, Switzerland, set out to elucidate the medium’s mechanisms. The team found that BCM incubated with bone chips for short periods—as little as ten minutes—contained heightened levels of signaling protein TGF-β1, which enhanced mouse bone marrow cell proliferation while downregulating maturation. BCM incubated for longer periods also generated increased levels of another protein, BMP-2, which boosted the maturation of bone-forming cells. This study reveals a sequential role of these two factors in oral bone development, and the potential physiological actions of BCM when used in regenerative therapies.","authors":"Maria B.

{"abstract":"The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) is pre-organised in oligomers, known as nanoclusters. Nanoclusters could provide a framework for inter-TCR cooperativity upon peptide antigen-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding. Here we have used soluble pMHC oligomers in search for cooperativity effects along the plasma membrane plane. We find that initial binding events favour subsequent pMHC binding to additional TCRs, during a narrow temporal window. This behaviour can be explained by a 3-state model of TCR transition from Resting to Active, to a final Inhibited state. By disrupting nanoclusters and hampering the Active conformation, we show that TCR cooperativity is consistent with TCR nanoclusters adopting the Active state in a coordinated manner. Preferential binding of pMHC to the Active TCR at the immunological synapse suggests that there is a transient time frame for signal amplification in the TCR, allowing the T cells to keep track of antigen quantity and binding time. T cells can be activated by a small, two-digit, number of antigen peptide molecules even though the receptor for antigen (TCR) is of low affinity. Here the authors present evidence that all TCRs within a nanocluster can become activated when only a subset is bound to antigen.","authors":"N. Martin-Blanco; R. Blanco; C. Alda-Catalinas; E. R.

{"abstract":"In cancer, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are frequently truncated, causing their encoded products to be non-functional or dominant-negative. We previously showed that premature polyadenylation (pPA) of MAGI3 truncates the gene, switching its functional role from a TSG to a dominant-negative oncogene. Here we report that MAGI3 undergoes pPA at the intron immediately downstream of its large internal exon, which is normally highly modified by N6-methyladenosine (m6A). In breast cancer cells that upregulate MAGI3 pPA , m6A levels in the large internal exon of MAGI3 are significantly reduced compared to cells that do not express MAGI3 pPA . We further find that MAGI3 pPA transcripts are significantly depleted of m6A modifications, in contrast to highly m6A-modified full-length MAGI3 mRNA. Finally, we analyze public expression data and find that other TSGs, including LATS1 and BRCA1, also undergo intronic pPA following large internal exons, and that m6A levels in these exons are reduced in pPA-activated breast cancer cells relative to untransformed mammary cells. Our study suggests that m6A may play a role in regulating intronic pPA of MAGI3 and possibly other TSGs, warranting further investigation.","authors":"Thomas K. Ni; Jessica S. Elman; Dexter X.

{"abstract":"Cacao is a crop of global relevance that faces constant demands for improved bean yield. However, little is known about the genomic regions controlling the crop yield and genes involved in cacao bean filling. Hence, to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with cacao yield and bean filling, we performed a QTL mapping in a segregating mapping population comprising 459 trees of a cross between ‘TSH 1188’ and ‘CCN 51’. All variables showed considerable phenotypic variation and had moderate to high heritability values. We identified 24 QTLs using a genetic linkage map that contains 3526 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Haplotype analysis at the significant QTL region on chromosome IV pointed to the alleles from the maternal parent, ‘TSH 1188’, as the ones that affect the cacao yield components the most. The recombination events identified within these QTL regions allowed us to identify candidate genes that may take part in the different steps of pod growth and bean filling. Such candidate genes seem to play a significant role in the source-to-sink transport of sugars and amino acids, and lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid production. The SNP markers mapped in our study are now being used to select potential high-yielding cacao varieties through marker-assisted selection in our existing cacao-breeding experiments.","authors":"Luciel dos Santos Fernandes; Fábio M.

This study investigated the association of HGP with the immune phenotype (IP) and clinical outcome after liver resection. CLM of patients treated with perioperative bevacizumab-based chemotherapy and liver resection were investigated. Association of HGP and IP with response, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was investigated. One hundred and eighteen patients (M/F 66/52, median age 62.3 (31.0–80.4) years, median follow-up 32.2 (5.0–92.7) months) were enrolled. The inflamed IP was associated with the desmoplastic HGP. The desmoplastic HGP was associated with better radiological and histological response compared to the replacement HGP, respectively. The replacement HGP was associated with shorter RFS (8.7 versus 16.3 months, HR 2.60, P = 0.001) and OS (36.6 months versus not reached, HR 2.32, P = 0.027), respectively. The non-inflamed IP was associated with shorter RFS (10.8 versus 16.5 months, HR 1.85, P = 0.029). The HGP but not the IP remained significant in multivariable analysis for RFS. The desmoplastic HGP is associated with the inflamed IP and HGP may be a potential biomarker for adjuvant treatment that includes targeting the immune contexture.","authors":"Stefan Stremitzer; Peter Vermeulen; Shannon Graver; Mark Kockx; Luc Dirix; Dongyun Yang; Wu Zhang; Judith Stift; Friedrich Wrba; Thomas Gruenberger; Heinz-Josef Lenz; Stefan J.

{"abstract":"Functional redundancy shared by paralog genes may afford protection against genetic perturbations, but it can also result in genetic vulnerabilities due to mutual interdependency1–5. Here, we surveyed genome-scale short hairpin RNA and CRISPR screening data on hundreds of cancer cell lines and identified MAGOH and MAGOHB, core members of the splicing-dependent exon junction complex, as top-ranked paralog dependencies6–8. MAGOHB is the top gene dependency in cells with hemizygous MAGOH deletion, a pervasive genetic event that frequently occurs due to chromosome 1p loss. Inhibition of MAGOHB in a MAGOH-deleted context compromises viability by globally perturbing alternative splicing and RNA surveillance. Dependency on IPO13, an importin-β receptor that mediates nuclear import of the MAGOH/B-Y14 heterodimer9, is highly correlated with dependency on both MAGOH and MAGOHB. Both MAGOHB and IPO13 represent dependencies in murine xenografts with hemizygous MAGOH deletion. Our results identify MAGOH and MAGOHB as reciprocal paralog dependencies across cancer types and suggest a rationale for targeting the MAGOHB-IPO13 axis in cancers with chromosome 1p deletion. Analysis of paralog gene pairs using data from loss-of-function genetic screens in cancer cells identifies MAGOH and MAGOHB as reciprocal paralog dependencies across cancer types.","authors":"Srinivas R.

{"abstract":"Cancer metabolism is significantly altered from normal cellular metabolism allowing cancer cells to adapt to changing microenvironments and maintain high rates of proliferation. In the past decade, stable-isotope tracing and network analysis have become powerful tools for uncovering metabolic pathways that are differentially activated in cancer cells. In particular, 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) has emerged as the primary technique for quantifying intracellular fluxes in cancer cells. In this review, we provide a practical guide for investigators interested in getting started with 13C-MFA. We describe best practices in 13C-MFA, highlight potential pitfalls and alternative approaches, and conclude with new developments that can further enhance our understanding of cancer metabolism. Tracing tagged molecules can help researchers understand the altered metabolism of cancer cells. The abilities of cancer cells to multiply rapidly and invade new tissues are supported by metabolic alterations, which can be investigated by feeding tagged molecules to cells and tracing how they are metabolized. These techniques, such as 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA), have been perceived as difficult to use, but recent advances are making them more accessible. Maciek Antoniewicz, University of Delaware, Newark, USA, has published a practical guide for researchers wanting to use 13C-MFA. The review includes best practices, pitfalls, alternative approaches, and new developments, especially new user-friendly software that allows researchers without extensive training in mathematics, statistics, or coding to perform 13C-MFA. Broadening access to tools for investigating altered metabolic pathways may spur development of new cancer therapies targeting these pathways.","authors":"Maciek R.

{"abstract":"MoO3 and Mo2C have emerged as remarkable catalysts for the selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of a wide range of oxygenates at low temperatures (that is, ≤673 K) and H2 pressures (that is, ≤1 bar). Although both catalysts can selectively cleave C–O bonds, the nature of their active sites remains unclear. Here we used operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to reveal important differences in the Mo 3d oxidation states between the two catalysts during the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole. This technique revealed that, although both catalysts featured a surface oxycarbidic phase, the oxygen content and the underlying phase of the material impacted the reactivity and product selectivity during the hydrodeoxygenation. MoO3 transitioned between 5+ and 6+ oxidation states during the operation, consistent with an oxygen-vacancy driven mechanism wherein the oxygenate is activated at undercoordinated Mo sites. In contrast, Mo2C showed negligible oxidation state changes during hydrodeoxygenation and maintained mostly 2+ states throughout the reaction. The nature of the active sites of molybdenum trioxide and molybdenum carbide, two related catalysts with great potential for hydrodeoxygenation reactions, is still under debate. Now, a comparative operando near-ambient-pressure XPS study during hydrodeoxygenation of anisole reveals important differences between these two materials. ","authors":"Karthick Murugappan; Eric M.

The measurements are extended to the quantum limit by reducing the drive power until, on average, less than one photon is present in the CPWR. Investigating the time-dependent response of the system to square pulses, oscillations in the output signal at the mode splitting frequency are observed.

{"abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health burden currently affecting 10–15% of adults worldwide. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a measure of kidney function and used to characterize chronic kidney disease.

{"abstract":"While every society can be exposed to heatwaves, some people suffer far less harm and recover more quickly than others from their occurrence. Here we project indicators of global heatwave risk associated with global warming of 1.5 and 2 °C, specified by the Paris agreement, for two future pathways of societal development representing low and high vulnerability conditions. Results suggest that at the 1.5 °C warming level, heatwave exposure in 2075 estimated for the population living in low development countries is expected to be greater than exposure at the warming level of 2 °C for the population living in very high development countries. A similar result holds for an illustrative heatwave risk index. However, the projected difference in heatwave exposure and the illustrative risk index for the low and very high development countries will be significantly reduced if global warming is stabilized below 1.5 °C, and in the presence of rapid social development. Climate extremes, exposure and vulnerability all contribute to global difference in heatwave risk. Here the authors investigated the inequality in global heatwave risk under both 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios and found that heatwave risk for the poor under 1.5 °C scenario exceeds that risk for the rich under 2 °C scenario.","authors":"Simone Russo; Jana Sillmann; Sebastian Sippel; Monika J.

{"abstract":"A broad panel of tens of thousands of microsatellite loci is unveiled for an endangered piracema (i.e. migratory) South American fish, Brycon orbignyanus. Once one of the main fisheries resources in the Platine Basin, it is now almost extinct in nature and focus of intense aquaculture activity. A total of 178.2 million paired-end reads (90 bases long) were obtained through the use of sequencing-by-synthesis (from a primary genomic library of 500 bp DNA fragments) and is made available through NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive, SRA accession SRX3350440. Short reads were assembled de novo and screening for perfect microsatellite motifs revealed more than 81 thousands unique microsatellite loci, for which primer pairs were proposed. A total of 29 polymorphic microsatellite markers were already previously validated for this panel. A partial genomic assembly is hereby presented and these genomic resources are publicly made available. These data will foster the rapid development of hundreds of new DNA markers for genetic diversity studies, conservation initiatives and management practices for this important and depleted species. The availability of such preliminary genomic data will also be of use in the areas of bioinformatics, ecology, genetics and evolution.","authors":"Gabriel M.

{"abstract":"Single molecule protein sequencing would represent a disruptive burst in proteomic research with important biomedical impacts. Due to their success in DNA sequencing, nanopore based devices have been recently proposed as possible tools for the sequencing of peptide chains. One of the open questions in nanopore protein sequencing concerns the ability of such devices to provide different signals for all the 20 standard amino acids. Here, using equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we estimated the pore clogging in α-Hemolysin nanopore associated to 20 different homopeptides, one for each standard amino acid. Our results show that pore clogging is affected by amino acid volume, hydrophobicity and net charge. The equilibrium estimations are also supported by non-equilibrium runs for calculating the current blockades for selected homopeptides. Finally, we discuss the possibility to modify the α-Hemolysin nanopore, cutting a portion of the barrel region close to the trans side, to reduce spurious signals and, hence, to enhance the sensitivity of the nanopore.","authors":"Giovanni Di Muccio; Aldo Eugenio Rossini; Daniele Di Marino; Giuseppe Zollo; Mauro Chinappi","keywords":"Nanopores; Protein sequencing","organization_affiliated":"Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Università di Roma Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy; Dipartimento di Scienze di Base e Applicate per l’Ingegneria, Università di Roma “La Sapienza”, Rome, Italy; Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Computational Science - Center for Computational Medicine in Cardiology Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Lugano, Switzerland; Polytechnic University of Marche, Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Ancona, Italy; Dipartimento di Scienze di Base e Applicate per l’Ingegneria, Università di Roma “La Sapienza”, Rome, Italy; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Università di Roma Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy","title":"Insights into protein sequencing with an α -Hemolysin nanopore by atomistic simulations","id":"ad1a1213-a44f-4e8c-840d-bd83b09fe872"}
{"abstract":"In 2015, we implemented an at-home allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) program. Between 2015 and 2018, 252 patients underwent allo-HCT; 41 patients underwent allo-HCT in the at-home program (46% myeloablative; 63% unrelated donor; 32% posttransplant cyclophosphamide), and these patients were compared with 39 in-patients; safety, capacity to release beds for other programs, and economic efficiency cost were evaluated. We observed a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia in the at-home group compared with that in the in-patient group (32% versus 90%; p \u003c 0.0001), whereas the incidence of aspergillosis was similar among groups (at-home 1% versus in-patient 3%; p = 0.5). The at-home patients showed a lower incidence of 1-year severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; 10% versus 29%; p = 0.03). There were no differences in 1-year transplant-related mortality, relapse, or overall survival among groups. The re-admission rate in the at-home group was 7%. The at-home setting was less expensive (9087 €/transplant), and its implementation increased capacity by 10.5 allo-HCTs/year. Moreover, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell program could be established without increasing beds. Thus, our at-home allo-HCT program may be a safe modality to reduce febrile neutropenia and acute GVHD, resulting in lower re-admission rates.","authors":"Gonzalo Gutiérrez-García; Montserrat Rovira;

{"abstract":"It is well known that Diptera and Lepidoptera can recognize tastes through their legs, which allows them to select suitable hosts. In Coleoptera, the largest insect order, however, the role of the legs in taste recognition to aid in host selection is unclear. In the present study, we investigated taste recognition through the legs of Chrysomelidae, Coleoptera. Through morphological observations, we found that all subfamilies of Chrysomelidae exhibit gustatory sensilla in the distal leg segment, i.e., the tarsus. In contrast, we did not find evidence of these sensilla in the species that we examined from four families of Coleoptera. We confirmed that different tastes, i.e., sweet, bitter, and leaf surface wax, were received through the tarsal sensilla of Chrysomelidae by recording the electrophysiological responses of the sensilla. Further, we found that Galerucella grisescens (Chrysomelidae) can respond to different tastes used in the electrophysiological tests using only their tarsi, whereas Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata (Coccinellidae), lacking tarsal gustatory sensilla, did not exhibit similar responses. Our results suggest that although tarsal taste recognition is not common throughout Coleopteran species, it may be a common feature in Chrysomelidae, and tarsal gustation may play an important role in host selection in this family.","authors":"Shun Yosano; Yasuhiko Kutsuwada; Minami Akatsu; Shuhei Masuta; Rei Kakazu; Naoshi Masuoka; Kazuhiro Matsuda; Masatoshi Hori","keywords":"Chemical ecology; Entomology","organization_affiliated":"Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan","title":"Taste recognition through tarsal gustatory sensilla potentially important for host selection in leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)","id":"bb77ba4f-228c-4235-ae8c-16d08a097c6f"}
{"abstract":"The quality of inverse problem solutions obtained through deep learning is limited by the nature of the priors learned from examples presented during the training phase. Particularly in the case of quantitative phase retrieval, spatial frequencies that are underrepresented in the training database, most often at the high band, tend to be suppressed in the reconstruction. Ad hoc solutions have been proposed, such as pre-amplifying the high spatial frequencies in the examples; however, while that strategy improves the resolution, it also leads to high-frequency artefacts, as well as low-frequency distortions in the reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach that learns separately how to handle the two frequency bands, low and high, and learns how to synthesize these two bands into full-band reconstructions. We show that this “learning to synthesize” (LS) method yields phase reconstructions of high spatial resolution and without artefacts and that it is resilient to high-noise conditions, e.g., in the case of very low photon flux. In addition to the problem of quantitative phase retrieval, the LS method is applicable, in principle, to any inverse problem where the forward operator treats different frequency bands unevenly, i.e., is ill-posed. A computational approach that avoids artifacts when extracting data about the phase of light from noisy intensity signals can improve imaging of transparent objects including cells. Mo Deng from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States, and colleagues have developed a procedure that separates raw intensity signals into high-frequency and low-frequency spectral channels. Then deep neural network algorithms, trained to operate in these two frequency bands, retrieve the phase information. A final algorithm recombines the two channels into a new phase image. The team’s experiments revealed that this method avoids the tendency of recent automatic phase extraction programs to over-represent low frequency signals, a quirk that reduces image resolution. The new reconstruction scheme is especially adept at handling noisy signal inputs, such as low light conditions.","authors":"Mo Deng; Shuai Li; Alexandre Goy; Iksung Kang; George Barbastathis","keywords":"Applied optics; Imaging and sensing","organization_affiliated":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Sensebrain Technology Limited LLC, San Jose, USA; Omnisens SA, Morges, Switzerland; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) Centre, Singapore, Singapore","title":"Learning to synthesize: robust phase retrieval at low photon counts","id":"e7206d8d-ac21-4175-95be-cb701e0bcd7b"}
{"abstract":"Melinjo seed extract (MSE) contains large amounts of polyphenols, including dimers of trans-resveratrol (e.g. gnetin C, L, gnemonoside A, B and D), and has been shown to potentially improve obesity. However, there is no clinical evidence regarding the anti-obesity effects of MSE, and its mechanisms are also unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that MSE supplementation increases the adiponectin (APN) multimerization via the up-regulation of disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) under either or both physiological and obese conditions. To investigate the effect of MSE on the physiological condition, 42 healthy young volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial for 14 days. The participants were randomly assigned to the MSE 150 mg/day, MSE 300 mg/day or placebo groups. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effect of MSE on APN levels under obese conditions, we administered MSE powder (500 or 1000 mg/kg/day) to control-diet- or high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks. All participants completed the clinical trial. The administration of MSE 300 mg/day was associated with an increase in the ratio of HMW/total APN in relation to the genes regulating APN multimerization, including DsbA-L. Furthermore, this effect of MSE was more pronounced in carriers of the DsbA-L rs191776 G/T or T/T genotype than in others. In addition, the administration of MSE to HFD mice suppressed their metabolic abnormalities (i.e. weight gain, increased blood glucose level and fat mass accumulation) and increased the levels of total and HMW APN in serum and the mRNA levels of ADIPOQ and DsbA-L in adipose tissue. The present study suggests that MSE may exert beneficial effects via APN multimerization in relation to the induction of DsbA-L under both physiological and obese conditions.","authors":"Kentaro Oniki; Taisei Kawakami; Azusa Nakashima; Keishi Miyata; Takehisa Watanabe; Haruka Fujikawa; Ryunosuke Nakashima; Aoi Nasu; Yuka Eto; Noriki Takahashi; Hirofumi Nohara; Mary Ann Suico; Shunsuke Kotani; Yui Obata; Yuki Sakamoto; Yuri Seguchi; Junji Saruwatari; Tadashi Imafuku; Hiroshi Watanabe; Toru Maruyama; Hirofumi Kai; Tsuyoshi Shuto","keywords":"Nutrition; Obesity","organization_affiliated":"Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Departments of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Organic Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","title":"Melinjo seed extract increases adiponectin multimerization in physiological and pathological conditions","id":"255502ac-d798-4e4b-910b-0ecd16b7c2f8"}
{"abstract":"Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is commonly associated with alterations in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical brain networks. Yet, recent investigations of large-scale brain networks suggest that more diffuse alterations in brain connectivity may underlie its pathophysiology. Few studies have assessed functional connectivity within or between networks across the whole brain in pediatric OCD or how patterns of connectivity associate with treatment response. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 25 unmedicated, treatment-naive children and adolescents with OCD (12.8 ± 2.9 years) and 23 matched healthy control (HC) participants (11.0 ± 3.3 years) before participants with OCD completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants were re-scanned after 12–16 weeks. Whole-brain connectomic analyses were conducted to assess baseline group differences and group-by-time interactions, corrected for multiple comparisons. Relationships between functional connectivity and OCD symptoms pre- and post-CBT were examined using longitudinal cross-lagged panel modeling. Reduced connectivity in OCD relative to HC participants was detected between default mode and task-positive network regions. Greater (less altered) connectivity between left angular gyrus and left frontal pole predicted better response to CBT in the OCD group. Altered connectivity between task-positive and task-negative networks in pediatric OCD may contribute to the impaired control over intrusive thoughts early in the illness. This is the first study to show that altered connectivity between large-scale network regions may predict response to CBT in pediatric OCD, highlighting the clinical relevance of these networks as potential circuit-based targets for the development of novel treatments.","authors":"Marilyn Cyr; David Pagliaccio; Paula Yanes-Lukin; Martine Fontaine; Moira A.

{"abstract":"Industrially profitable water splitting is one of the great challenges in the development of a viable and sustainable hydrogen economy. Alkaline electrolysers using Earth-abundant catalysts remain the most economically viable route to electrolytic hydrogen, but improved efficiency is desirable. Recently, electron spin polarization was described as a potential way to improve water-splitting catalysis. Here, we report the significant enhancement of alkaline water electrolysis when a moderate magnetic field (≤450 mT) is applied to the anode. Current density increments above 100% (over 100 mA cm−2) were found for highly magnetic electrocatalysts, such as the mixed oxide NiZnFe4Ox. Magnetic enhancement works even for decorated Ni–foam electrodes with very high current densities, improving their intrinsic activity by about 40% to reach over 1 A cm−2 at low overpotentials. Thanks to its simplicity, our discovery opens opportunities for implementing magnetic enhancement in water splitting. Some of the best electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolysers are based on oxides of nickel and iron. Here, the authors demonstrate that the water oxidation performance of such catalysts can be enhanced by application of a magnetic field from a permanent magnet.","authors":"Felipe A.

{"abstract":"Recently proposed accurate correlation energies are used to determine the phase diagram of strongly coupled electron-hole graphene bilayers. The control parameters of the phase diagram are the charge carrier density and the insulating barrier thickness separating the bilayers. In addition to the electron-hole superfluid phase we find two new inhomogeneous ground states, a one dimensional charge density wave phase and a coupled electron-hole Wigner crystal. The elementary crystal structure of bilayer graphene plays no role in generating these new quantum phases, which are completely determined by the electrons and holes interacting through the Coulomb interaction. The experimental parameters for the new phases lie within attainable ranges and therefore coupled electron-hole bilayer graphene presents itself as an experimental system where novel emergent many-body phases can be realized.","authors":"M.

{"abstract":"Young-onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD), defined by onset at \u003c50 years, accounts for approximately 10% of all Parkinson’s disease cases and, while some cases are associated with known genetic mutations, most are not. Here induced pluripotent stem cells were generated from control individuals and from patients with YOPD with no known mutations. Following differentiation into cultures containing dopamine neurons, induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with YOPD showed increased accumulation of soluble α-synuclein protein and phosphorylated protein kinase Cα, as well as reduced abundance of lysosomal membrane proteins such as LAMP1. Testing activators of lysosomal function showed that specific phorbol esters, such as PEP005, reduced α-synuclein and phosphorylated protein kinase Cα levels while increasing LAMP1 abundance. Interestingly, the reduction in α-synuclein occurred through proteasomal degradation. PEP005 delivery to mouse striatum also decreased α-synuclein production in vivo. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic cultures reveal a signature in patients with YOPD who have no known Parkinson’s disease-related mutations, suggesting that there might be other genetic contributions to this disorder. This signature was normalized by specific phorbol esters, making them promising therapeutic candidates. iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons from patients with young-onset Parkinson’s disease exhibit molecular abnormalities, including elevated α-synuclein and lysosomal dysfunction, which can be normalized with phorbol ester treatment.","authors":"A.

However, the measures in omega complexity are sensitive to the number of neural time-series. Here, normalized spatial complexity was suggested to overcome the above limitation, and was verified by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data from a previous published autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research. By this new method, several conclusions consistent with traditional approaches on the pathological mechanisms of ASD were found, i.e., the prefrontal cortex made a major contribution to the hypo-connectivity of young children with ASD. Moreover, some novel findings were also detected (e.g., significantly higher normalized regional spatial complexities of bilateral prefrontal cortices and the variability of normalized local complexity differential of right temporal lobe, and the regional differences of measures in normalized regional spatial complexity), which could not be successfully detected via traditional approaches. These results confirmed the value of this novel approach, and extended the methodology system of functional connectivity. This novel technique could be applied to the neural signal of other neuroimaging techniques and other neurological and cognitive conditions.","authors":"Huibin Jia; Yanwei Li; Dongchuan Yu","keywords":"Neuroscience; Optical imaging","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Child Development and Learning Science (Ministry of Education), Research Center for Learning Science, School of Biological Sciences \u0026 Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; College of Preschool Education, Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Learning Science (Ministry of Education), Research Center for Learning Science, School of Biological Sciences \u0026 Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","title":"Normalized spatial complexity analysis of neural signals","id":"fce2813f-a1b1-46a8-a7b1-b5e8185e982f"}
{"abstract":"Despite extensive efforts in recent years, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant obstacle for drug delivery. This study proposes using a clinical extracorporeal shockwave instrument to open the BBB, combined with a laser assisted bi-axial locating platform to achieve non-invasive, controllable-focus and reversible BBB opening in the brains of rats. Under shockwave treatment with an intensity level of 5 (P–9.79 MPa, energy flux density (EFD) 0.21 mJ/mm2) and a pulse repetition frequency of 5 Hz, the BBB could be opened after 50 shocks without the use of an ultrasound contrast agent. With the proposed method, the BBB opening can be precisely controlled in terms of depth, size and location. Moreover, a shockwave based gene transfection was demonstrated using a luciferase gene.","authors":"Yi Kung; Chiang Lan; Ming-Yen Hsiao; Ming-Kuan Sun; Yi-Hua Hsu; Abel P.-H.

{"abstract":"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been shown to improve survival for men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer undergoing external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Using data from a community-based prospective disease registry, we investigated usage of EBRT with or without neoadjuvant ADT. The CaPSURE database contains 14,863 men with prostate cancer, including 1337 men diagnosed between 1990 and 2014 with localized disease who received EBRT as primary treatment. Prostate cancer risk was calculated using the CAPRA score. Patient characteristics were compared using the Mantel–Haenszel chi-square test for trend and analysis of variance. Between 1990 and 2014, 14,010 men were diagnosed with localized disease within the CaPSURE registry. Of those, 1337 underwent EBRT. Patients had a median age of 71 years. The use of ADT in addition to EBRT increased from 24% in 1990 to 60% in 1996 with a decrease seen to 47% in 2011. Men receiving ADT have differing clinical characteristics including higher PSA at diagnosis, higher Gleason grade, and higher CAPRA scores. Median ADT duration was 4 months. The use of ADT in conjunction with primary EBRT has increased in frequency and duration since 1990. Men receiving ADT have higher risk characteristics than those receiving EBRT alone. There is substantial variability in use of ADT in clinical practice.","authors":"Bogdana Schmidt; Renu S. Eapen; Janet E. Cowan; Jeanette M. Broering; Kirsten L. Greene; Peter R. Carroll; Matthew R.

{"abstract":"Sulphotransferases are a diverse group of enzymes catalysing the transfer of a sulfuryl group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulphate (PAPS) to a broad range of secondary metabolites. They exist in all kingdoms of life. In Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. twenty-two sulphotransferase (SOT) isoforms were identified. Three of those are involved in glucosinolate (Gl) biosynthesis, glycosylated sulphur-containing aldoximes containing chemically different side chains, whose break-down products are involved in stress response against herbivores, pathogens, and abiotic stress. To explain the differences in substrate specificity of desulpho (ds)-Gl SOTs and to understand the reaction mechanism of plant SOTs, we determined the first high-resolution crystal structure of the plant ds-Gl SOT AtSOT18 in complex with 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) alone and together with the Gl sinigrin. These new structural insights into the determination of substrate specificity were complemented by mutagenesis studies. The structure of AtSOT18 invigorates the similarity between plant and mammalian sulphotransferases, which illustrates the evolutionary conservation of this multifunctional enzyme family. We identified the essential residues for substrate binding and catalysis and demonstrated that the catalytic mechanism is conserved between human and plant enzymes. Our study indicates that the loop-gating mechanism is likely to be a source of the substrate specificity in plants.","authors":"Felix Hirschmann; Florian Krause; Petra Baruch; Igor Chizhov; Jonathan Wolf Mueller; Dietmar J.

{"abstract":"The pro-inflammatory cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is pivotal to the pathophysiology of widespread allergic diseases mediated by type 2 helper T cell (Th2) responses, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. The emergence of human TSLP as a clinical target against asthma calls for maximally harnessing its therapeutic potential via structural and mechanistic considerations. Here we employ an integrative experimental approach focusing on productive and antagonized TSLP complexes and free cytokine. We reveal how cognate receptor TSLPR allosterically activates TSLP to potentiate the recruitment of the shared interleukin 7 receptor α-chain (IL-7Rα) by leveraging the flexibility, conformational heterogeneity and electrostatics of the cytokine. We further show that the monoclonal antibody Tezepelumab partly exploits these principles to neutralize TSLP activity. Finally, we introduce a fusion protein comprising a tandem of the TSLPR and IL-7Rα extracellular domains, which harnesses the mechanistic intricacies of the TSLP-driven receptor complex to manifest high antagonistic potency. The pro-inflammatory cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a promising therapeutic target. Here the authors characterize the assembly mechanism of the receptor complex driven by human TSLP, and its antagonism by the monoclonal antibody Tezepelumab and a fusion protein comprising the TSLP receptors.","authors":"Kenneth Verstraete; Frank Peelman; Harald Braun; Juan Lopez; Dries Van Rompaey; Ann Dansercoer; Isabel Vandenberghe; Kris Pauwels; Jan Tavernier; Bart N.

{"abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading infectious cause of death worldwide. The use of ethionamide (ETH), a main second line anti-TB drug, is hampered by its severe side effects. Recently discovered “booster” molecules strongly increase the ETH efficacy, opening new perspectives to improve the current clinical outcome of drug-resistant TB. To investigate the simultaneous delivery of ETH and its booster BDM41906 in the lungs, we co-encapsulated these compounds in biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), overcoming the bottlenecks inherent to the strong tendency of ETH to crystallize and the limited water solubility of this Booster. The efficacy of the designed formulations was evaluated in TB infected macrophages using an automated confocal high-content screening platform, showing that the drugs maintained their activity after incorporation in NPs. Among tested formulations, “green” β-cyclodextrin (pCD) based NPs displayed the best physico-chemical characteristics and were selected for in vivo studies. The NPs suspension, administered directly into mouse lungs using a Microsprayer®, was proved to be well-tolerated and led to a 3-log decrease of the pulmonary mycobacterial load after 6 administrations as compared to untreated mice. This study paves the way for a future use of pCD NPs for the pulmonary delivery of the [ETH:Booster] pair in TB chemotherapy.","authors":"Joana Costa-Gouveia; Elisabetta Pancani; Samuel Jouny; Arnaud Machelart; Vincent Delorme; Giuseppina Salzano; Raffaella Iantomasi; Catherine Piveteau; Christophe J.

{"abstract":"Tree mortality appears to be increasing in moist tropical forests1, with potentially important implications for global carbon and water cycles2. Little is known about the drivers of tree mortality in these diverse forests, partly because long-term data are lacking3. The relative importance of climatic factors and species functional traits as drivers of tropical tree mortality are evaluated using a unique dataset in which the survival of over 1,000 rainforest canopy trees from over 200 species has been monitored monthly over five decades in the Central Amazon. We found that drought, as well as heat, storms and extreme rainy years, increase tree mortality for at least two years after the climatic event. Specific functional groups (pioneers, softwoods and evergreens) had especially high mortality during extreme years. These results suggest that predicted climate change will lead to higher tree mortality rates, especially for short-lived species, which may result in faster carbon sequestration but lower carbon storage of tropical forests. Fifty years of monthly observation of rainforest canopy trees in the Central Amazon reveals that drought, heat, storms and extreme rain can all increase tree mortality. Pioneers, softwoods and evergreen functional groups were particularly vulnerable.","authors":"Izabela Aleixo; Darren Norris; Lia Hemerik; Antenor Barbosa; Eduardo Prata; Flávia Costa; Lourens Poorter","keywords":"Climate change; Climate-change ecology; Forest ecology; Tropical ecology","organization_affiliated":"Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, the Netherlands; Coordenação de Pesquisas em Biodiversidade, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biodiversidade Tropical, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Macapá, Brazil; Coordenação de Ciências Ambientais, Universidade Federal do Amapá, Macapá, Brazil; Biometris, Mathematical and Statistical Methods, Wageningen University, Wageningen, the Netherlands; Coordenação de Tecnologia e Inovação, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Coordenação de Dinâmica Ambiental, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Coordenação de Pesquisas em Biodiversidade, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil; Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, the Netherlands","title":"Amazonian rainforest tree mortality driven by climate and functional traits","id":"ada3aa84-923b-4678-9a42-068743140c68"}

{"abstract":"Mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (mROS) are frequently associated with DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, but physiological increases in mROS serve to regulate specific cell functions. T3 is a major regulator of mROS, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we show that exogenous thyroid hormone (T3) administration increases cardiomyocyte numbers in neonatal murine hearts. The mechanism involves signaling by mitochondria-generated H2O2 (mH2O2) acting via the redox sensor, peroxiredoxin-1, a thiol peroxidase with high reactivity towards H2O2 that activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase-2α2 (JNK2α2). JNK2α2, a relatively rare member of the JNK family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphorylates c-Jun, a component of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) early response transcription factor, resulting in enhanced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression and activation of proliferative ERK1/2 signaling. This non-canonical mechanism of MAPK activation couples T3 actions on mitochondria to cell cycle activation. Although T3 is regarded as a maturation factor for cardiomyocytes, these studies identify a novel redox pathway that is permissive for T3-mediated cardiomyocyte proliferation—this because of the expression of a pro-proliferative JNK isoform that results in growth factor elaboration and ERK1/2 cell cycle activation.","authors":"Lin Tan; Nikolay Bogush; Hussain Naib; Jennifer Perry; John W.

{"abstract":"Bacillus subtilis MifM is a monitoring substrate of the YidC pathways of protein integration into the membrane and controls the expression of the YidC2 (YqjG) homolog by undergoing regulated translational elongation arrest. The elongation arrest requires interactions between the MifM nascent polypeptide and the ribosomal components near the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) as well as at the constriction site of the ribosomal exit tunnel. Here, we addressed the roles played by more N-terminal regions of MifM and found that, in addition to the previously-identified arrest-provoking elements, the MifM residues 41–60 likely located at the tunnel exit and outside the ribosome contribute to the full induction of elongation arrest. Mutational effects of the cytosolically exposed part of the ribosomal protein uL23 suggested its involvement in the elongation arrest, presumably by interacting with the extra-ribosomal portion of MifM. In vitro translation with reconstituted translation components recapitulated the effects of the mutations at the 41–60 segment, reinforcing the importance of direct molecular interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome. These results indicate that the nascent MifM polypeptide interacts extensively with the ribosome both from within and without to direct the elongation halt and consequent up-regulation of YidC2.","authors":"Keigo Fujiwara; Koreaki Ito; Shinobu Chiba","keywords":"Membrane proteins; Ribosome","organization_affiliated":"Faculty of Life Sciences and Institute for Protein Dynamics, Kyoto Sangyo University, Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-Ku, Kyoto, Japan; Faculty of Life Sciences and Institute for Protein Dynamics, Kyoto Sangyo University, Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-Ku, Kyoto, Japan; Faculty of Life Sciences and Institute for Protein Dynamics, Kyoto Sangyo University, Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-Ku, Kyoto, Japan","title":"MifM-instructed translation arrest involves nascent chain interactions with the exterior as well as the interior of the ribosome","id":"88c26ac7-f3a1-47cf-aaa2-efda26296b82"}
{"abstract":"Topological metals, including Dirac and Weyl semimetals, represent a wide class of quantum materials with non-trivial electronic band structures. The essential properties of Dirac or Weyl fermions, including light effective mass and high mobility, have been observed in a number of semimetal compounds, which in turn exhibit large positive magnetoresistances. Here, we report an unexpected observation of all these properties in α-gallium (α-Ga) single crystals, a pure metal that is in the liquid phase at room temperature and ambient pressure. Based on systematical transport measurements, α-Ga single crystal is found to exhibit large magnetoresistance, reaching about 1.66 × 106 per cent at 2 K in a magnetic field of 9 T. At low temperatures the de Haas–van Alphen and Shubinikov de Hass quantum oscillations show ultrahigh mobility and very small cyclotron effective mass for charge carriers, together with a non-trivial Berry phase. Combined with first-principle band structure calculations, these properties demonstrate α-Ga as a rare topological pure metal. Furthermore, superconductivity with Tc of ~0.9 K is confirmed by both specific heat and resistivity measurements. These findings suggest that α-Ga is a unique pure metal displaying both non-trivial topological and superconducting properties. A comprehensive investigation of bulk properties of α-Ga single crystals grown using a super cooled method—Ga is a metal that is liquid at room temperature—revealed that at very low temperatures this material exhibits a number of interesting properties; in particular, topology and superconductivity coexist. Bin Chen and colleagues measured a very large magnetoresistance, accompanied by a light effective mass and high mobility for the charge carriers, properties that suggest that the material is a topological metal. This conclusion is supported by first-principle calculations. Moreover, previous measurements indicating that the material is superconducting at very low temperature were experimentally confirmed. Materials exhibiting both topological properties and superconductivity provide a useful testing ground for understanding the interplay between superconducting pairing mechanisms and topology of the electronic band structure.","authors":"Bin Chen; Xu Duan; Hangdong Wang; Jianhua Du; Yuxing Zhou; Chunqiang Xu; Yukun Zhang; Liyao Zhang; Meng Wei; Zhengcai Xia; Chao Cao; Jianhui Dai; Minghu Fang; Jinhu Yang","keywords":"Materials science; Topological matter","organization_affiliated":"Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Hangzhou Key Laboratory of Quantum Matter, Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China","title":"Large magnetoresistance and superconductivity in α -gallium single crystals","id":"5a5831b5-0ee1-4b6e-8039-a0c88e848955"}
{"abstract":"Our goals was to evaluate how sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) benefit neck management in patients with parotid cancer. Patients diagnosed with cN0 parotid cancer by preoperative fine needle puncture were prospectively enrolled. The neck status was evaluated by SLNB. If node metastasis was proved by SLNB, a neck dissection of level I–V a was performed, or a wait-and-see policy was conducted for the patient. All related information was extracted and analyzed. Positive SLNB result occurred in 33 (16.7%) patients, and level II metastasis was noted in 100% of the patients. Isolated level III metastasis was noted in 3 (9.1%) patients. During our follow-up with mean time of 49.5 months, 20 patients developed regional recurrence, in which 6 patients had neck dissection as part of their initial management. All the recurrent neck disease was successfully salvaged. Therefore, SLNB was a reliable procedure for neck management in parotid cancer.","authors":"Wenting Pan; Kai Ba; Xingyu Niu; Fei Liu; Qigen Fang","keywords":"Head and neck cancer; Oral cancer detection; Outcomes research; Salivary gland diseases; Surgical oncology","organization_affiliated":"Stomatology Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, P.R.

{"abstract":"While surgery is at the foundation of cancer treatment, its access is limited in low-income countries. Here, we describe development of a low-cost alternative therapy based on intratumoral ethanol injection suitable for resource-limited settings. Although ethanol-based tumor ablation is successful in treating hepatocellular carcinomas, the necessity for multiple treatments, injection of large fluid volumes, and decreased efficacy in treatment of non-capsulated tumors limit its applicability. To address these limitations, we investigated an enhanced ethanol ablation strategy to retain ethanol within the tumor through the addition of ethyl cellulose. This increases the viscosity of injected ethanol and forms an ethanol-based gel-phase upon exposure to the aqueous tumor environment. This technique was first optimized to maximize distribution volume, using tissue-simulating phantoms. Then, chemically-induced epithelial tumors in the hamster cheek pouch were treated. As controls, pure ethanol injections of either four times or one-fourth the tumor volume induced complete regression of 33% and 0% of tumors, respectively. In contrast, ethyl cellulose-ethanol injections of one-fourth the tumor volume induced complete regression in 100% of tumors. These results contribute to proof-of-concept for enhanced ethanol ablation as a novel and effective alternative to surgery for tumor treatment, with relevance to resource-limited settings.","authors":"Robert Morhard; Corrine Nief; Carlos Barrero Castedo; Fangyao Hu; Megan Madonna; Jenna L.

{"abstract":"The RecBCD complex plays key roles in phage DNA degradation, CRISPR array acquisition (adaptation) and host DNA repair. The switch between these roles is regulated by a DNA sequence called Chi. We report cryo-EM structures of the Escherichia coli RecBCD complex bound to several different DNA forks containing a Chi sequence, including one in which Chi is recognized and others in which it is not. The Chi-recognized structure shows conformational changes in regions of the protein that contact Chi and reveals a tortuous path taken by the DNA. Sequence specificity arises from interactions with both the RecC subunit and the sequence itself. These structures provide molecular details for how Chi is recognized and insights into the changes that occur in response to Chi binding that switch RecBCD from bacteriophage destruction and CRISPR spacer acquisition to constructive host DNA repair. Cryo-EM structures of E. coli RecBCD complex with different DNA fork templates containing a Chi sequence reveal the conformational changes upon Chi recognition.","authors":"Kaiying Cheng; Martin Wilkinson; Yuriy Chaban; Dale B.

{"abstract":"This study investigated the cecal microbiota and serum metabolite profile of chickens fed with plant essential oils (PEO) or virginiamycin (VIRG) using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics approach. The main aim of this work was to explore the biochemical mechanisms involved in the improved growth performance of antibiotics and their alternatives in animal production. The results showed that both PEO and VIRG treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of phyla Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of phyla Firmicutes and genus of Lactobacillus in cecal microbiota of chickens. Compared to the control group (CT group), the relative abundance of genus of Alistipes, unclassified Rikenellaceae, Roseburia, and Anaeroplasma was enriched in the PEO group; that of genus Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and unclassified Enterobacteriaceae was enriched in the cecal microbiota of the VIRG group. Untargeted metabolomics analyses revealed that the PEO treatment modified 102 metabolites and 3 KEGG pathways (primary bile acid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism) in the cecal microbiota, and 81 metabolites and relevant KEGG pathways (fructose and mannose metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid.) in the serum of the chicken. Compared to the CT group, VIRG treatment group differed 217 metabolites and 10 KEGG pathways in cecal contents and 142 metabolites and 7 KEGG pathways in serum of chickens. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that phyla Bacteroidetes and genus of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and unclassified Rikenellaceae (in the VIRG and PE group) were positively correlated with many lipid metabolites. However, phyla Firmicutes and genera Lactobacillus (higher in the CT group) were negatively correlated with the lipid and thymine metabolism, and positively correlated with hydroxyisocaproic acid, cytosine, and taurine. This study shows that dietary supplementation with PEO and VIRG altered the composition and metabolism profile of the cecal microbiota, modified the serum metabolism profile.","authors":"Yan Chen; Jun Wang; Longfei Yu; Tianyue Xu; Nianhua Zhu","keywords":"Microbial communities; Microbiology","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, College of animal science and technology, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, P.

{"abstract":"Animals have evolved various sex-specific characteristics to improve the efficiency of mating encounters. One is the sex-specific attracting signal. Signal receivers perform a combination of random search and navigation before and after signal detections. On the other hand, signal senders can also modify their movement patterns to optimize their encounter rates, which invokes a reverse side of random search problems that asks for the most efficient movement patterns of signal senders to be found by signal receivers. In this study, we focused on visual and auditory signals in particular, and quantified the efficiency of mating encounters of individual animals performing a Lévy walk, a special class of random walk, with a variety of speeds before signal detection. We found that signal senders should move more slowly and/or less diffusively than receivers to improve mating encounters. The optimal movement patterns of senders ranged from relatively slow to stationary ones depending on the density of individuals, the effective range of signals, and the ability of receivers to locate senders. By focusing on the optimal movement patterns of individuals that are often assumed to be given targets, the present study provides insights into strategies of effective attraction beyond the case of mate search.","authors":"Nobuaki Mizumoto; Shigeto Dobata","keywords":"Behavioural ecology; Computational models","organization_affiliated":"Laboratory of Insect Ecology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa-oiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Japan; Laboratory of Insect Ecology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa-oiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Japan","title":"The optimal movement patterns for mating encounters with sexually asymmetric detection ranges","id":"ca6e6db0-b022-44a3-9ee1-e00008190c8d"}
{"abstract":"Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 (lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein 4β-35) is associated with a poor prognosis in numerous malignant tumours. Expression patterns and effects of LAPTM4B-35 on head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic relevance of LAPTM4B-35 in HNSCC. Tissue microarrays were constructed with primary tumours and associated lymph node metastases isolated from 127 patients. The expression of LAPTM4B-35 was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the results were correlated with survival data. LAPTM4B-35 in the primary tumour was highly expressed in 47.2% of the patients (60/127). LAPTM4B-35 expression was significantly associated with tumour stage. Moreover, overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 correlated with a significantly worse disease-free survival (10.23 years vs. not reached) and a higher recurrence rate (40.7% vs. 25%). High expression of LAPTM4B-35 in lymph node metastasis was found in 29.2% of cases. In 19.4% of cases, high LAPTM4B-35 expression was observed in both the primary tumour and corresponding lymph node metastases. In conclusion, our data indicates that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 is associated with poor prognosis and may therefore serve as a new prognostic marker in HNSCC.","authors":"Ulana Kotowski; Lorenz Kadletz; Sven Schneider; Felicitas Oberndorfer; Julia Schnoell; Elisabeth Gurnhofer; Lukas Kenner; Trevor Lucas; Gregor Heiduschka","keywords":"Cancer; Cell biology; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria; Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department for Cell and Developmental Biology, Medical University of Vienna, Schwarzspanierstraße 17, Vienna, Austria; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria","title":"Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 is a negative prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","id":"f03840af-1650-458c-926f-1fea1e39a06e"}
{"abstract":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) forms biofilms on necrotic tissues and medical devices, and causes persistent infections. Surfactants act on biofilms, but their mode of action is still unknown. If used in the clinic, cytotoxicity in tissues should be minimized. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of four different surfactants on MRSA biofilm formation, and found that a nonionic surfactant, polysorbate 80 (PS80), was the most suitable. The biofilm inhibitory effects resulted from the inhibition of bacterial adhesion to substrates rather than biofilm disruption, and the effective dose was less cytotoxic for 3T3 fibroblasts. However, the effects were substrate-dependent: positive for plastic, silicon, and dermal tissues, but negative for stainless-steel. These results indicate that PS80 is effective for prevention of biofilms formed by MRSA on tissues and foreign bodies. Therefore, PS80 could be used in medical practice as a washing solution for wounds and/or pretreatment of indwelling catheters.","authors":"Yutaka Ueda; Kota Mashima; Motoyasu Miyazaki; Shuuji Hara; Tohru Takata; Hidetoshi Kamimura; Satoshi Takagi; Shiro Jimi","keywords":"Applied microbiology; Biofilms","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pharmacy, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Pharmacy, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Pharmacy, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Drug Informatics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Pharmacy, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Central Laboratory for Pathology and Morphology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan","title":"Inhibitory effects of polysorbate 80 on MRSA biofilm formed on different substrates including dermal tissue","id":"ce0b0626-0c81-4cf2-8373-59794f06aa87"}
{"abstract":"Three woody shrub species [cleyera (Ternstroemia gymnanthera Thunb. ‘Conthery’), Indian hawthorn (Rhaphiolepis indica L.) and loropetalum (Loropetalum chinensis Oliv.‘Ruby’)] were container-grown for one growing season in 2008 using either pinebark (industry standard), clean chip residual or WholeTree (derived by-products from the forestry industry) as potting substrates and then transplanted into the landscape in 2008. An Automated Carbon Efflux System was used to continually monitor soil CO2 efflux from December 2010 through November 2011 in each species and substrate combination. Changes in soil carbon (C) levels as a result of potting substrate were assessed through soil sampling in 2009 and 2011 and plant biomass was determined at study conclusion. Results showed that soil CO2-C efflux was similar among all species and substrates, with few main effects of species or substrate observed throughout the study. Soil analysis showed that plots with pinebark contained higher levels of soil C in both 2009 and 2011, suggesting that pinebark decomposes slower than clean chip residual or WholeTree and consequently has greater C storage potential than the two alternative substrates. Results showed a net C gain for all species and substrate combinations; however, plants grown in pinebark had greater C sequestration potential.","authors":"S. Christopher Marble; Stephen A.

{"abstract":"Patients with inborn errors of amino acid metabolism frequently show neuropsychiatric symptoms despite accurate metabolic control. This study aimed to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of neural dysfunction. Here we analyzed the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 10 genes required for correct brain functioning in plasma and blood of patients with Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD), Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) and controls. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of potential biomarkers. CACNA2D2 (α2δ2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) and MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) mRNA and protein showed an excellent neural function biomarker signature (AUC ≥ 0,925) for recognition of MSUD. THBS3 (thrombospondin 3) mRNA and AABA gave a very good biomarker signature (AUC 0,911) for executive-attention deficits. THBS3, LIN28A mRNA, and alanine showed a perfect biomarker signature (AUC 1) for behavioral and mood disorders. Finally, a panel of BDNF protein and at least two large neural AAs showed a perfect biomarker signature (AUC 1) for recognition of psychomotor delay, pointing to excessive protein restriction as central causative of psychomotor delay. To conclude, our study has identified promising biomarker panels for neural function evaluation, providing a base for future studies with larger samples.","authors":"Alba-Aina Castells; Daniela Gueraldi; Rafel Balada; Alba Tristán-Noguero; Elisenda Cortès-Saladelafont; Federico Ramos; Silvia Meavilla; Mariela De Los Santos; Camila Garcia-Volpe; Roser Colomé; Maria Luz Couce; Cristina Sierra; Aida Ormazábal; Marta Batllori; Rafael Artuch; Judith Armstrong; Soledad Alcántara; Àngels Garcia-Cazorla","keywords":"Diseases of the nervous system; Paediatric neurological disorders","organization_affiliated":"Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Neural Development Lab, Departament de Patologia i Terapèutica Experimental, Institut de Neurociències, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBELL, l’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Neural Development Lab, Departament de Patologia i Terapèutica Experimental, Institut de Neurociències, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBELL, l’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Santiago de Compostela, Universidad de Santiago, CIBERER, IDIS, MetabERN, Santiago de Compostela, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain; Neural Development Lab, Departament de Patologia i Terapèutica Experimental, Institut de Neurociències, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBELL, l’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; Metabolic Unit, Departments of Neurology, Nutrition Biochemistry and Genetics, Institut Pediàtric de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERER, ISCIII and metabERN, Hospital San Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain","title":"Discovery of Biomarker Panels for Neural Dysfunction in Inborn Errors of Amino Acid Metabolism","id":"d2929892-9d77-470d-a086-17447f126334"}

Here, Murphy and Hartley assess therapeutic approaches and challenges in targeting mitochondria and highlight examples of promising indications. Although the development of mitochondrial therapies has largely focused on diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, it has been found that mitochondrial dysfunction also contributes to the pathology of many common disorders, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disease, heart failure, ischaemia–reperfusion injury and protozoal infections. Mitochondria therefore represent an important drug target for these highly prevalent diseases.

{"abstract":"Social processes are associated with depression, particularly understanding and responding to others, deficits in which can manifest as callousness/unemotionality (CU). Thus, CU may reflect some of the genetic risk to depression. Further, this vulnerability likely reflects the neurological substrates of depression, presenting biomarkers to capture genetic vulnerability of depression severity. However, heritability varies within brain regions, so a high-resolution genetic perspective is needed. We developed a toolbox that maps genetic and environmental associations between brain and behavior at high resolution. We used this toolbox to estimate brain areas that are genetically associated with both depressive symptoms and CU in a sample of 258 same-sex twin pairs from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS). We then overlapped the two maps to generate coordinates that allow for tests of downstream effects of genes influencing our clusters. Genetic variance influencing cortical thickness in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) sulci and gyri, ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), pre-somatic motor cortex (PreSMA), medial precuneus, left occipital-temporal junction (OTJ), parietal–temporal junction (PTJ), ventral somatosensory cortex (vSMA), and medial and lateral precuneus were genetically associated with both depression and CU. Split-half replication found support for both DLPFC clusters. Meta-analytic term search identified “theory of mind”, “inhibit”, and “pain” as likely functions. Gene and transcript mapping/enrichment analyses implicated calcium channels. CU reflects genetic vulnerability to depression that likely involves executive and social functioning in a distributed process across the cortex. This approach works to unify neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and genetics to discover pathways to psychiatric vulnerability.","authors":"Alexander S. Hatoum; Andrew E. Reineberg; Harry R.

{"abstract":"Social interactions play an increasingly recognized key role in bacterial physiology1. One of the best studied is quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to the status of cell density2. While QS is generally deemed crucial for bacterial survival, QS-dysfunctional mutants frequently arise in in vitro culture. This has been explained by the fitness cost an individual mutant, a ‘quorum cheater’, saves at the expense of the community3. QS mutants are also often isolated from biofilm-associated infections, including cystic fibrosis lung infection4, as well as medical device infection and associated bacteraemia5–7. However, despite the frequently proposed use of QS blockers to control virulence8, the mechanisms underlying QS dysfunctionality during infection have remained poorly understood. Here, we show that in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, quorum cheaters arise exclusively in biofilm infection, while in non-biofilm-associated infection there is a high selective pressure to maintain QS control. We demonstrate that this infection-type dependence is due to QS-dysfunctional bacteria having a significant survival advantage in biofilm infection because they form dense and enlarged biofilms that provide resistance to phagocyte attacks. Our results link the benefit of QS-dysfunctional mutants in vivo to biofilm-mediated immune evasion, thus to mechanisms that are specific to the in vivo setting. Our findings explain why QS mutants are frequently isolated from biofilm-associated infections and provide guidance for the therapeutic application of QS blockers.

{"abstract":"Chromatin architectural proteins (CAPs) bind the entry/exit DNA of nucleosomes and linker DNA to form higher order chromatin structures with distinct transcriptional outcomes. How CAPs mediate nucleosome dynamics is not well understood. We hypothesize that CAPs regulate DNA target site accessibility through alteration of the rate of spontaneous dissociation of DNA from nucleosomes. We investigated the effects of histone H1, high mobility group D1 (HMGD1), and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), on the biophysical properties of nucleosomes and chromatin. We show that MeCP2, like the repressive histone H1, traps the nucleosome in a more compact mononucleosome structure. Furthermore, histone H1 and MeCP2 hinder model transcription factor Gal4 from binding to its cognate DNA site within the nucleosomal DNA. These results demonstrate that MeCP2 behaves like a repressor even in the absence of methylation. Additionally, MeCP2 behaves similarly to histone H1 and HMGD1 in creating a higher-order chromatin structure, which is susceptible to chromatin remodeling by ISWI. Overall, we show that CAP binding results in unique changes to nucleosome structure and dynamics.","authors":"Caitlyn Riedmann; Yvonne N.

{"abstract":"Transmission eigenchannels are building blocks of coherent wave transport in diffusive media, and selective excitation of individual eigenchannels can lead to diverse transport behaviour. An essential yet poorly understood property is the transverse spatial profile of each eigenchannel, which is relevant for the associated energy density and critical for coupling light into and out of it. Here, we discover that the transmission eigenchannels of a disordered slab possess exponentially localized incident and outgoing profiles, even in the diffusive regime far from Anderson localization. Such transverse localization arises from a combination of reciprocity, local coupling of spatial modes and non-local correlations of scattered waves. Experimentally, we observe signatures of such localization even with finite illumination area. The transverse localization of high-transmission channels enhances optical energy densities inside turbid media, which will be important for light–matter interactions and imaging applications. Transverse localization of transmission eigenchannels is discovered in random optical media even in the diffusive regime of propagation far from Anderson localization. These findings will have significant impact on imaging and the control of light–matter interactions in scattering systems.","authors":"Hasan Yılmaz; Chia Wei Hsu; Alexey Yamilov; Hui Cao","keywords":"Applied optics; Imaging and sensing; Optical physics; Optics and photonics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, USA; Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, USA; Department of Physics, Missouri University of Science \u0026 Technology, Rolla, USA; Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, USA","title":"Transverse localization of transmission eigenchannels","id":"4e551cfb-6d66-4644-9c03-d02c71b08c4b"}

Targeted deletion of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin1 (MFN1) in oocytes resulted in female infertility associated with failure to achieve oocyte maturation. Oocyte-granulosa cell communication was impaired, and cadherins and connexins were downregulated, resulting in follicle developmental arrest at the secondary follicle stage. Deletion of MFN1 in oocytes resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial dynamics, as well as accumulation of ceramide, which contributed to increased apoptosis and a reproductive phenotype that was partially rescued by treatment with ceramide synthesis inhibitor myriocin. Absence of MFN1 and resulting apoptotic cell loss also caused depletion of ovarian follicular reserve, and a phenotype consistent with accelerated female reproductive aging.","authors":"Man Zhang; Muhammed Burak Bener; Zongliang Jiang; Tianren Wang; Ecem Esencan; Richard Scott III; Tamas Horvath; Emre Seli","keywords":"Cell proliferation; Oogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; AgCenter, School of Animal Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Foundation for Embryonic Competence, Basking Ridge, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Comparative Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA","title":"Mitofusin 1 is required for female fertility and to maintain ovarian follicular reserve","id":"532d2f36-2935-4dc4-af26-5d8a31a2e1a5"}
{"abstract":"African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma) are vector-borne haemoparasites that survive in the vertebrate bloodstream through antigenic variation of their Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). Recombination, or rather segmented gene conversion, is fundamental in Trypanosoma brucei for both VSG gene switching and for generating antigenic diversity during infections. Trypanosoma vivax is a related, livestock pathogen whose VSG lack structures that facilitate gene conversion in T. brucei and mechanisms underlying its antigenic diversity are poorly understood. Here we show that species-wide VSG repertoire is broadly conserved across diverse T. vivax clinical strains and has limited antigenic repertoire. We use variant antigen profiling, coalescent approaches and experimental infections to show that recombination plays little role in diversifying T. vivax VSG sequences. These results have immediate consequences for both the current mechanistic model of antigenic variation in African trypanosomes and species differences in virulence and transmission, requiring reconsideration of the wider epidemiology of animal African trypanosomiasis. Trypanosoma rely on variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) to escape host immunity, but mechanisms generating antigenic diversity of VSG are poorly understood. Here, Silva-Pereira et al. show that T. vivax has a limited antigenic repertoire compared to T. brucei and that recombination plays little role in diversifying T. vivax VSG sequences.","authors":"Sara Silva Pereira; Kayo J.

{"abstract":"Microbial communities in human-impacted soils of ancient settlements have been proposed to be used as ecofacts (bioindicators) of different ancient anthropogenic activities. In this study, bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities inhabiting soil of three archaic layers, excavated at the archaeological site on Monte Iato (Sicily, Italy) and believed to have been created in a chronological order in archaic times in the context of periodic cultic feasts, were investigated in terms of (i) abundance (phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and quantitative PCR)), (ii) carbon(C)-source consumption patterns (Biolog-Ecoplates) and (iii) diversity and community composition (Illumina amplicon sequencing). PLFA analyses demonstrated the existence of living bacteria and fungi in the soil samples of all three layers. The upper layer showed increased levels of organic C, which were not concomitant with an increment in the microbial abundance. In taxonomic terms, the results indicated that bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities were highly diverse, although differences in richness or diversity among the three layers were not detected for any of the communities. However, significantly different microbial C-source utilization patterns and structures of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the three layers confirmed that changing features of soil microbial communities reflect different past human activities.","authors":"José A.

{"abstract":"Aripiprazole’s effects on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia are unclear because of the difficulty in disentangling specific effects on cognitive function from secondary effects due to the improvement in other schizophrenic symptoms. One approach to address this is to use an intermediate biomarker to investigate the relationship between the drug’s effect on the brain and change in cognitive function. This study aims to investigate aripiprazole’s effect on working memory by determining the correlation between dopamine D2/3 (D2/3) receptor occupancy and working memory of patients with schizophrenia. Seven patients with schizophrenia participated in the study. Serial positron emission tomography (PET) scans with [11C]raclopride were conducted at 2, 26, and 74 h after the administration of aripiprazole. The subjects performed the N-back task just after finishing the [11C]raclopride PET scan. The mean (±SD) D2/3 receptor occupancies were 66.9 ± 6.7% at 2 h, 65.0 ± 8.6% at 26, and 57.7 ± 11.2% at 74 h after administering aripiprazole. Compared with performance on the zero-back condition, performance in memory-loaded conditions (one-, two-, and three-back conditions) was significantly related to D2/3 receptor occupancy by aripiprazole (error rate: ß = −2.236, t = −6.631, df = 53.947, and p = 0.001; reaction time: ß = −9.567, t = −2.808, df = 29.967, and p = 0.009). Although the sample size was relatively small, these results suggest that aripiprazole as a dopamine-partial agonist could improve cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.","authors":"Sangho Shin; Seoyoung Kim; Seongho Seo; Jae Sung Lee; Oliver D.

{"abstract":"Browning of subcutaneous white fat (iWAT) involves several reprograming events, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Hlx is selectively expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and iWAT, and is translationally upregulated by β3-adrenergic signaling-mediated suppression of the translational inhibitor 4E-BP1. Hlx interacts with and is co-activated by Prdm16 to control BAT-selective gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. Hlx heterozygous knockout mice have defects in brown-like adipocyte formation in iWAT, and develop glucose intolerance and high fat-induced hepatic steatosis. Conversely, transgenic expression of Hlx at a physiological level drives a full program of thermogenesis and converts iWAT to brown-like fat, which improves glucose homeostasis and prevents obesity and hepatic steatosis. The adipose remodeling phenotypes are recapitulated by fat-specific injection of Hlx knockdown and overexpression viruses, respectively. Our studies establish Hlx as a powerful regulator for systematic white adipose tissue browning and offer molecular insights into the underlying transcriptional mechanism. The transcriptional co-activator Prdm16 regulates browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, the authors show that Prdm16 interacts with the transcription factor Hlx, which is stabilized in response to β3-adrenergic signaling, to increase thermogenic gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in subcutaneous WAT.","authors":"Lei Huang; Dongning Pan; Qingbo Chen; Lihua J.

This unique feature has enabled applications ranging from use as biochemical tools to therapeutic agents. Nanobodies have emerged as especially useful tools in protein structural biology, facilitating studies of conformationally dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Nearly all nanobodies available to date have been obtained by animal immunization, a bottleneck restricting many applications of this technology. To solve this problem, we report a fully in vitro platform for nanobody discovery based on yeast surface display. We provide a blueprint for identifying nanobodies, demonstrate the utility of the library by crystallizing a nanobody with its antigen, and most importantly, we utilize the platform to discover conformationally selective nanobodies to two distinct human GPCRs. To facilitate broad deployment of this platform, the library and associated protocols are freely available for nonprofit research. Yeast surface display platform allows nanobody discovery within two to three weeks.

{"abstract":"Phenotypic variation is a hallmark of cellular physiology. Metabolic heterogeneity, in particular, underpins single-cell phenomena such as microbial drug tolerance and growth variability. Much research has focussed on transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity, yet it remains unclear if such variation permeates to the metabolic state of a cell. Here we propose a stochastic model to show that complex forms of metabolic heterogeneity emerge from fluctuations in enzyme expression and catalysis. The analysis predicts clonal populations to split into two or more metabolically distinct subpopulations. We reveal mechanisms not seen in deterministic models, in which enzymes with unimodal expression distributions lead to metabolites with a bimodal or multimodal distribution across the population. Based on published data, the results suggest that metabolite heterogeneity may be more pervasive than previously thought. Our work casts light on links between gene expression and metabolism, and provides a theory to probe the sources of metabolite heterogeneity. Mona Tonn et al. propose a stochastic model to elucidate the mechanisms by which non-genetic heterogeneity arises in metabolic reactions. They find that even unimodal enzyme expression fluctuations can lead to highly heterogeneous metabolite profiles with two or more metabolically distinct subpopulations of cells.","authors":"Mona K.

An Fmoc group, an effective drug-interactive motif, is also introduced into the carrier to improve the drug loading capacity and formulation stability.

{"abstract":"Mitochondria provide chemical energy for endoergonic reactions in the form of ATP, and their activity must meet cellular energy requirements, but the mechanisms that link organelle performance to ATP levels are poorly understood. Here we confirm the existence of a protein complex localized in mitochondria that mediates ATP-dependent potassium currents (that is, mitoKATP). We show that—similar to their plasma membrane counterparts—mitoKATP channels are composed of pore-forming and ATP-binding subunits, which we term MITOK and MITOSUR, respectively. In vitro reconstitution of MITOK together with MITOSUR recapitulates the main properties of mitoKATP. Overexpression of MITOK triggers marked organelle swelling, whereas the genetic ablation of this subunit causes instability in the mitochondrial membrane potential, widening of the intracristal space and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. In a mouse model, the loss of MITOK suppresses the cardioprotection that is elicited by pharmacological preconditioning induced by diazoxide. Our results indicate that mitoKATP channels respond to the cellular energetic status by regulating organelle volume and function, and thereby have a key role in mitochondrial physiology and potential effects on several pathological processes. The pore-forming and ATP-binding subunits of a mitochondrial protein complex that mediates ATP-dependent potassium currents are identified and characterized, revealing the role of this channel in mitochondrial physiology and pathologies.","authors":"Angela Paggio; Vanessa Checchetto; Antonio Campo; Roberta Menabò; Giulia Di Marco; Fabio Di Lisa; Ildiko Szabo; Rosario Rizzuto; Diego De Stefani","keywords":"Energy metabolism; Potassium channels","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy","title":"Identification of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel in mitochondria","id":"768c98fa-e390-46b8-9eda-e4dde846376d"}
{"abstract":"The innate immune system helps animals to navigate the microbial world. The response to microbes relies on the specific recognition of microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by immune receptors. Sponges (phylum Porifera), as early-diverging animals, provide insights into conserved mechanisms for animal-microbe crosstalk. However, experimental data is limited. We adopted an experimental approach followed by RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analysis in order to characterise the sponge immune response. Two Mediterranean species, Aplysina aerophoba and Dysidea avara, were exposed to a “cocktail” of MAMPs (lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan) or to sterile artificial seawater (control) and sampled 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h post-treatment for RNA-Seq. The response involved, first and foremost, a higher number of differentially-expressed genes in A. aerophoba than D. avara. Secondly, while both species constitutively express a diverse repertoire of immune receptors, they differed in their expression profiles upon MAMP challenge. The response in D. avara was mediated by increased expression of two NLR genes, whereas the response in A. aerophoba involved SRCR and GPCR genes. From the set of annotated genes we infer that both species activated apoptosis in response to MAMPs while in A. aerophoba phagocytosis was additionally stimulated. Our study assessed for the first time the transcriptomic responses of sponges to MAMPs and revealed conserved and species-specific features of poriferan immunity as well as genes potentially relevant to animal-microbe interactions.","authors":"Lucía Pita; Marc P.

Along with de novo biosynthesis, free FAs derive from dietary sources or from intracellular lipid droplets, which represent the storage of triacylglycerols (TAGs). Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme of lipolysis, catalysing the first step of intracellular TAGs hydrolysis in several tissues. However, the roles of ATGL in cancer are still neglected though a putative tumour suppressor function of ATGL has been envisaged, as its expression is frequently reduced in different human cancers (e.g., lung, muscle, and pancreas). In this review, we will introduce lipid metabolism focusing on ATGL functions and regulation in normal cell physiology providing also speculative perspectives on potential non-energetic functions of ATGL in cancer. In particular, we will discuss how ATGL is implicated, mainly through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) signalling, in inflammation, redox homoeostasis and autophagy, which are well-known processes deregulated during cancer formation and/or progression.","authors":"Rolando Vegliante; Luca Di Leo; Fabio Ciccarone; Maria Rosa Ciriolo","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biology, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome, Italy; IRCCS San Raffaele ‘La Pisana’, Rome, Italy","title":"Hints on ATGL implications in cancer: beyond bioenergetic clues","id":"f1b50cd4-2346-44e7-9bae-7b9d63a61314"}
{"abstract":"In Africa, livestock production currently accounts for about 30% of the gross value of agricultural production. However, production is struggling to keep up with the demands of expanding human populations, the rise in urbanization and the associated shifts in diet habits. High costs of feed prevent the livestock sector from thriving and to meet the rising demand. Insects have been identified as potential alternatives to the conventionally used protein sources in livestock feed due to their rich nutrients content and the fact that they can be reared on organic side streams. Substrates derived from organic by-products are suitable for industrial large-scale production of insect meal. Thus, a holistic comparison of the nutritive value of Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL) reared on three different organic substrates, i.e. chicken manure (CM), brewers’ spent grain (SG) and kitchen waste (KW), was conducted. BSFL samples reared on every substrate were collected for chemical analysis after the feeding process. Five-hundred (500) neonatal BSFL were placed in 23 × 15 cm metallic trays on the respective substrates for a period of 3–4 weeks at 28 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 5% relative humidity. The larvae were harvested when the prepupal stage was reached using a 5 mm mesh size sieve. A sample of 200 grams prepupae was taken from each replicate and pooled for every substrate and then frozen at −20 °C for chemical analysis. Samples of BSFL and substrates were analyzed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extracts (EE), ash, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), amino acids (AA), fatty acids (FA), vitamins, flavonoids, minerals and aflatoxins. The data were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using general linear model procedure. BSFL differed in terms of nutrient composition depending on the organic substrates they were reared on. CP, EE, minerals, amino acids, ADF and NDF but not vitamins were affected by the different rearing substrates. BSFL fed on different substrates exhibited different accumulation patterns of minerals, with CM resulting in the largest turnover of minerals. Low concentrations of heavy metals (cadmium and lead) were detected in the BSFL, but no traces of aflatoxins were found. In conclusion, it is possible to take advantage of the readily available organic waste streams in Kenya to produce nutrient-rich BSFL-derived feed.","authors":"Marwa Shumo; Isaac M. Osuga; Fathiya M.

{"abstract":"Formation of 100S ribosome dimer is generally associated with translation suppression in bacteria. Trans-acting factors ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and hibernating promoting factor (HPF) were shown to directly mediate this process in E. coli. Gram-positive S. aureus lacks an RMF homolog and the structural basis for its 100S formation was not known. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native 100S ribosome from S. aureus, revealing the molecular mechanism of its formation. The structure is distinct from previously reported analogs and relies on the HPF C-terminal extension forming the binding platform for the interactions between both of the small ribosomal subunits. The 100S dimer is formed through interactions between rRNA h26, h40, and protein uS2, involving conformational changes of the head as well as surface regions that could potentially prevent RNA polymerase from docking to the ribosome. Under conditions of nutrient limitation, bacterial ribosomes undergo dimerization, forming a 100S complex that is translationally inactive. Here the authors present the structural basis for formation of the 100S complexes in Gram-positive bacteria, shedding light on the mechanism of translation suppression by the ribosome-silencing factors.","authors":"Donna Matzov; Shintaro Aibara; Arnab Basu; Ella Zimmerman; Anat Bashan; Mee-Ngan F.

{"abstract":"Nature makes use of molecular machines to perform intricate functions in every significant biological process and to power macroscopic motion in organisms. Biomolecular motor proteins perform crucial tasks such as cell division, intracellular transport and mechanical actuation in biological cells. The rotary motor FoF1-ATPase is one of the most extensively studied biomolecular machines as a result of its vital physiological function. Research on the function of FoF1-ATPase can help to better understand the underlying biological processes and may also result in the development of biological molecular motor-based devices or even inspire the creative design and construction of artificial molecular machines. Recent advances in nanoscience and biotechnology have enabled engineering experiments with FoF1-ATPase that have achieved notable success. In this Review, we first outline the reconstitution of FoF1-ATPase into simple liposomes and polymersomes and then focus on recent progress in the reconstitution of FoF1-ATPase on layer-by-layer-assembled systems. The elaborate structural designs utilized in layer-by-layer-assembled systems to better mimic natural cell structures are introduced. The rational integration of functional components to achieve stimuli-responsive ATP syntheses from FoF1-ATPase-based biomimetic systems is highlighted. Finally, we address some remaining key challenges and speculate on future directions for the field. FoF1-ATPase is a vital molecular machine in organisms responsible for the catalytic synthesis of the basic energy unit ATP. In this Review, the development of FoF1-ATPase reconstitution into artificial architectures is discussed ultimately leading to the development of stimuli-responsive ATP synthesis.

{"abstract":"The molecular events that initiate lymphoid-lineage specification remain unidentified. Cumano and colleagues define the transcriptional signatures that characterize the loss of B cell or T cell potential. The molecular events that initiate lymphoid-lineage specification remain unidentified because the stages of differentiation during which lineage commitment occurs are difficult to characterize. We isolated fetal liver progenitor cells undergoing restriction of their differentiation potential toward the T cell–innate lymphoid cell lineage or the B cell lineage. Transcripts that defined the molecular signatures of these two subsets were sequentially upregulated in lympho-myeloid precursor cells and in common lymphoid progenitor cells, respectively, and this preceded lineage restriction; this indicates that T cell–versus–B cell commitment is not a binary fate 'decision'. The T cell–bias and B cell–bias transcriptional programs were frequently co-expressed in common lymphoid progenitor cells and were segregated in subsets biased toward T cell differentiation or B cell differentiation, after interleukin 7 (IL-7) signaling that controlled the number of progenitor cells engaging in T cell differentiation versus B cell differentiation.","authors":"Claire Berthault; Cyrille Ramond; Odile Burlen-Defranoux; Guillaume Soubigou; Sylvestre Chea; Rachel Golub; Pablo Pereira; Paulo Vieira; Ana Cumano","keywords":"Lymphopoiesis; Molecular biology","organization_affiliated":"Unit for Lymphopoiesis, Pasteur Institute.

{"abstract":"High-gamma signals mirror the tuning and temporal profiles of neurons near a recording electrode in sensory and motor areas. These frequencies appear to aggregate local neuronal activity, but it is unclear how this relationship affects information encoding in high-gamma activity (HGA) in cortical areas where neurons are heterogeneous in selectivity and temporal responses, and are not functionally clustered. Here we report that populations of neurons and HGA recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode similar information, although there is little correspondence between signals recorded by the same electrode. HGA appears to aggregate heterogeneous neuron activity, such that the spiking of a single cell corresponds to only small increases in HGA. Interestingly, large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics are revealed in HGA, but less apparent in the population of single neurons. Overall, HGA is closely related to neuron activity in OFC, and provides a unique means of studying large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of information processing. High gamma activity (HGA) and local neurons encode similar information, but it’s unclear if this is true when neurons are heterogeneous, as in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here, Rich \u0026 Wallis show that HGA in OFC is closely related to neuron firing, but reveals clearer spatiotemporal dynamics.","authors":"Erin L. Rich; Joni D.

{"abstract":"Neutrophil surveillance is central to nanoparticle clearance. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have numerous uses, however conflicting evidence exists as to their impact on neutrophils and whether they trigger damaging inflammation. Neutrophil’s importance in innate defence and regulating immune networks mean it’s essential we understand AgNP’s impact on neutrophil function. Human neutrophil viability following AgNP or Ag Bulk treatment was analysed by flow cytometry and AnV/PI staining. Whilst AgNP exposure did not increase the total number of apoptotic neutrophils, the number of late apoptotic neutrophils was increased, suggesting AgNP increase transit through apoptosis. Mature (CD16bright/CD62Lbright), immature (CD16dim/CD62Lbright) and apoptotic (CD16dim/CD62Ldim) neutrophil populations were evident within isolated neutrophil preparations. AgNP exposure significantly reduced CD62L staining of CD16bright/CD62Lbright neutrophils, and increased CD16 staining of CD16dim/CD62Lbright populations, suggesting AgNPs trigger neutrophil activation and maturation, respectively. AgNP exposure dramatically increased IL-8, yet not classical pro-inflammatory cytokine release, suggesting AgNP triggers neutrophil activation, without pro-inflammation or damaging, necrotic cell death. For the first time, we show AgNPs differentially affect distinct sub-populations of circulating human neutrophils; activating mature neutrophils with the emergence of CD16bright/CD62Ldim neutrophils. This may stimulate particle clearance without harmful inflammation, challenging previous assumptions that silver nanomaterials induce neutrophil toxicity and damaging inflammatory responses.","authors":"Jennifer A.

{"abstract":"With a rapidly aging global human population, finding a cure for late onset neurodegenerative diseases has become an urgent enterprise. However, these efforts are hindered by the lack of understanding of what constitutes the phenotype of aged human microglia—the cell type that has been strongly implicated by genetic studies in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Here, we establish the set of genes that is preferentially expressed by microglia in the aged human brain. This HuMi_Aged gene set captures a unique phenotype, which we confirm at the protein level. Furthermore, we find this gene set to be enriched in susceptibility genes for Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, to be increased with advancing age, and to be reduced by the protective APOEε2 haplotype. APOEε4 has no effect. These findings confirm the existence of an aging-related microglial phenotype in the aged human brain and its involvement in the pathological processes associated with brain aging. Aging is associated with various changes in the brain, including transcription alteration.

We hypothesized that overexpression of xCT occurs in lung cancer cells to satisfy the metabolic requirements for growth and survival. Our results demonstrated that 1) xCT was highly expressed at the cytoplasmic membrane in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 2) the expression of xCT was correlated with advanced stage and predicted a worse 5-year survival, 3) targeting xCT transport activity in xCT overexpressing NSCLC cells with sulfasalazine decreased cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo and 4) increased dependence on glutamine was observed in xCT overexpressed normal airway epithelial cells.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after conservative surgery offers several advantages over conventional RT including improved acute and late toxicity and quality of life (QoL). We undertook this study to prospectively evaluate acute (≤90 days after last dose of radiotherapy) and long-term (\u003e90 days) cutaneous, esophageal, and fibrosis toxicity and QoL in breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant IMRT after breast surgery. We included patients with complex volumes for which 3D RT does not allow a good coverage of target volumes and sparing organs at risk. We report here an interim analysis with a median follow-up of 13.1 months (range, 6.5–25.9 months). Most of the acute toxicity was cutaneous (95.9%) and oesophageal (59.6%), and mostly grade 1 and 2. Medium-term cutaneous toxicity rate was 25.6%, and mostly grade 1. Medium-term esophageal toxicity was rare (1.8%). In this series acute oesophageal toxicity was found to be associated with dosimetric factors. QoL was well preserved throughout the study, and aesthetic outcomes were good.

{"abstract":"Kucha (Camellia sinensis) is a kind of unique wild tea resources in southwest China, containing sizeable amounts of theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) and having a special bitter taste both in fresh leaves and made tea. Theacrine has good healthy function locally. But the molecular mechanism of theacrine metabolism in Kucha was still unclear. In order to illuminate the biosynthesis and catabolism of theacrine in Kucha plants, three tea cultivars, C. sinensis ‘Shangyou Zhongye’ (SY) with low-theacrine, ‘Niedu Kucha 2’ (ND2) with middle-theacrine and, ‘Niedu Kucha 3’ (ND3) with high-theacrine, were used for our research. Purine alkaloid analysis and transcriptome of those samples were performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and RNA-Seq, respectively. The related gene expression levels of purine alkaloid were correlated with the content of purine alkaloid, and the results of quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR were also confirmed the reliability of transcriptome. Based on the data, we found that theacrine biosynthesis is a relatively complex process, N-methyltransferase (NMT) encoded by TEA024443 may catalyze the methylation at 9-N position in Kucha plant. Our finding will assist to reveal the molecular mechanism of theacrine biosynthesis, and be applied to selection and breeding of Kucha tea cultivars in the future.","authors":"Songlin Wang; Jiedan Chen; Jianqiang Ma; Jiqiang Jin; Liang Chen; Mingzhe Yao","keywords":"Plant sciences; Secondary metabolism","organization_affiliated":"Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China; Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China; Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China; Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China; Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China; Tea Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Tea Biology and Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 9 South Meiling Road, Zhejiang, China","title":"Novel insight into theacrine metabolism revealed by transcriptome analysis in bitter tea (Kucha, Camellia sinensis )","id":"609ac247-cfbb-4b00-b542-5ffde22b0d1f"}
{"abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction is a common cardiovascular complication of CKD. MicroRNA-212 (miR-212) has been demonstrated previously to be a crucial regulator of pathologic LVH in pressure-overload-induced heart failure via regulating the forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway. Here we aimed to investigate whether miR-212 and its hypertrophy-associated targets including FOXO3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) play a role in the development of HFpEF in CKD. CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. Echocardiography and histology revealed LVH, fibrosis, preserved systolic function, and diastolic dysfunction in the CKD group as compared to sham-operated animals eight and/or nine weeks later. Left ventricular miR-212 was significantly overexpressed in CKD. However, expressions of FOXO3, AMPK, and ERK2 failed to change significantly at the mRNA or protein level. The protein kinase B (AKT)/FOXO3 and AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways are also proposed regulators of LVH induced by pressure-overload. Interestingly, phospho-AKT/total-AKT ratio was increased in CKD without significantly affecting phosphorylation of FOXO3 or mTOR. In summary, cardiac overexpression of miR-212 in CKD failed to affect its previously implicated hypertrophy-associated downstream targets. Thus, the molecular mechanism of the development of LVH in CKD seems to be independent of the FOXO3, ERK1/2, AMPK, and AKT/mTOR-mediated pathways indicating unique features in this form of LVH.","authors":"Márta Sárközy; Renáta Gáspár; Ágnes Zvara; Andrea Siska; Bence Kővári; Gergő Szűcs; Fanni Márványkövi; Mónika G.

{"abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. As obesity and diabetes become more prevalent, the contribution of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to HCC is rising. Recently, we reported intrahepatic CD4+ T cells are critical for anti-tumor surveillance in NAFLD. Lipid accumulation in the liver is the hallmark of NAFLD, which may perturb T cell function. We sought to investigate how the lipid-rich liver environment influences CD4+ T cells by focusing on carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) family members, which control the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids and act as key molecules in lipid catabolism. Linoleic acid (C18:2) co-localized within the mitochondria along with a corresponding increase in CPT gene upregulation. This CPT upregulation can be recapitulated by feeding mice with a high-C18:2 diet or the NAFLD promoting methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Using an agonist and antagonist, the induction of CPT genes was found to be mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). CPT gene upregulation increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and led to cell apoptosis. In vivo, using liver-specific inducible MYC transgenic mice fed MCD diet, blocking CPT with the pharmacological inhibitor perhexiline decreased apoptosis of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells and inhibited HCC tumor formation. These results provide useful information for potentially targeting the CPT family to rescue intrahepatic CD4+ T cells and to aid immunotherapy for NAFLD-promoted HCC.","authors":"Zachary J.

{"abstract":"The capacity of working memory is limited and this limit is comparable in crows and primates. To maximize this resource, humans use attention to select only relevant information for maintenance. Interestingly, attention-cues are effective not only before but also after the presentation of to-be-remembered stimuli, highlighting control mechanisms beyond sensory selection. Here we explore if crows are also capable of these forms of control over working memory. Two crows (Corvus corone) were trained to memorize two, four or six visual stimuli. Comparable to our previous results, the crows showed a decrease in performance with increasing working memory load. Using attention cues, we indicated the critical stimulus on a given trial. These cues were either presented before (pre-cue) or after sample-presentation (retro-cue). On other trials no cue was given as to which stimulus was critical. We found that both pre- and retro-cues enhance the performance of the birds. These results show that crows, like humans, can utilize attention to select relevant stimuli for maintenance in working memory. Importantly, crows can also utilize cues to make the most of their working memory capacity even after the stimuli are already held in working memory. This strongly implies that crows can engage in efficient control over working memory.","authors":"Erica Fongaro; Jonas Rose","keywords":"Animal behaviour; Cognitive control; Working memory","organization_affiliated":"Faculty of Psychology, Neural Basis of Learning, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany; Faculty of Psychology, Neural Basis of Learning, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany","title":"Crows control working memory before and after stimulus encoding","id":"cd7d50a6-5d5b-4eab-9eb9-dd3f0641f15c"}
{"abstract":"Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P \u003c 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P \u003c 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P \u003c 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P \u003c 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.","authors":"Hong Wang; Juan D.

{"abstract":"Epidemiology evidenced the Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical found in daily consumer products, as an environmental contributor to obesity and type II diabetes (T2D) in Humans. However, the BPA-mediated effects supporting these metabolic disorders are still unknown. Knowing that obesity and T2D are associated with low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis, we performed a longitudinal study in mice to determine the sequential adverse effects of BPA on immune system and intestinal microbiota that could contribute to the development of metabolic disorders. We observed that perinatal exposure to BPA (50 µg/kg body weight/day) induced intestinal and systemic immune imbalances at PND45, through a decrease of Th1/Th17 cell frequencies in the lamina propria concomitant to an increase of splenic Th1/Th17 immune responses. These early effects are associated with an altered glucose sensitivity, a defect of IgA secretion into faeces and a fall of faecal bifidobacteria relative to control mice. Such BPA-mediated events precede infiltration of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in gonadal white adipose tissue appearing with ageing, together with a decreased insulin sensitivity and an increased weight gain. Our findings provide a better understanding of the sequential events provoked by perinatal exposure to BPA that could support metabolic disorder development in later life.","authors":"Yann Malaisé; Sandrine Menard; Christel Cartier; Eric Gaultier; Frédéric Lasserre; Corinne Lencina; Cherryl Harkat; Nancy Geoffre; Laïla Lakhal; Isabelle Castan; Maïwenn Olier; Eric Houdeau; Laurence Guzylack-Piriou","keywords":"Metabolic diseases; Microbiology; Mucosal immunology","organization_affiliated":"Intestinal Development, Xenobiotics and ImmunoToxicology team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Neuro-Gastroenterology and Nutrition team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Intestinal Development, Xenobiotics and ImmunoToxicology team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Intestinal Development, Xenobiotics and ImmunoToxicology team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Integrative Toxicology and Metabolism team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Neuro-Gastroenterology and Nutrition team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Neuro-Gastroenterology and Nutrition team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Adipocyte secretions, obesities and related diseases team, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Université Paul Sabatier (UPS), Unité Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 1048, Institut des Maladies Métaboliques et Cardiovasculaires (I2MC), Toulouse, France; Integrative Toxicology and Metabolism team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Adipocyte secretions, obesities and related diseases team, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Université Paul Sabatier (UPS), Unité Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 1048, Institut des Maladies Métaboliques et Cardiovasculaires (I2MC), Toulouse, France; Neuro-Gastroenterology and Nutrition team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Intestinal Development, Xenobiotics and ImmunoToxicology team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France; Intestinal Development, Xenobiotics and ImmunoToxicology team, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France","title":"Gut dysbiosis and impairment of immune system homeostasis in perinatally-exposed mice to Bisphenol A precede obese phenotype development","id":"7d0de7b2-2617-4f9b-8706-e07b0f1ef9fd"}
{"abstract":"Asymmetric cell divisions are required for cellular diversity and defects can lead to altered daughter cell fates and numbers. In a genetic screen for C. elegans mutants with defects in dopaminergic head neuron specification or differentiation, we isolated a new allele of the transcription factor HAM-1 [HSN (Hermaphrodite-Specific Neurons) Abnormal Migration]. Loss of both HAM-1 and its target, the kinase PIG-1 [PAR-1(I)-like Gene], leads to abnormal dopaminergic head neuron numbers. We identified discrete genetic relationships between ham-1, pig-1 and apoptosis pathway genes in dopaminergic head neurons. We used an unbiased, quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to characterise direct and indirect protein targets and pathways that mediate the effects of PIG-1 kinase loss in C. elegans embryos. Proteins showing changes in either abundance, or phosphorylation levels, between wild-type and pig-1 mutant embryos are predominantly connected with processes including cell cycle, asymmetric cell division, apoptosis and actomyosin-regulation. Several of these proteins play important roles in C. elegans development. Our data provide an in-depth characterisation of the C. elegans wild-type embryo proteome and phosphoproteome and can be explored via the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (EPD) – an open access, searchable online database.","authors":"Sarah-Lena Offenburger; Dalila Bensaddek; Alejandro Brenes Murillo; Angus I.

{"abstract":"Ferroelectric materials possess a spontaneous polarization that is switchable by an electric field. Robust retention of switched polarization is critical for non-volatile nanoelectronic devices based on ferroelectrics, however, these materials often suffer from polarization relaxation, typically within days to a few weeks. Here we exploit designer-defect-engineered epitaxial BiFeO3 films to demonstrate polarization retention with virtually no degradation in switched nanoscale domains for periods longer than 1 year. This represents a more than 2000% improvement over the best values hitherto reported. Scanning probe microscopy-based dynamic switching measurements reveal a significantly increased activation field for domain wall movement. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy indicates that nanoscale defect pockets pervade the entire film thickness. These defects act as highly efficient domain wall pinning centres, resulting in anomalous retention. Our findings demonstrate that defects can be exploited in a positive manner to solve reliability issues in ferroelectric films used in functional devices. The use of ferroelectric materials in memory device applications is held back by low retention times. Here, the authors demonstrate that by intentionally introducing defective nanoregions which increase the activation field for domain wall motion, retention times larger than a year can be achieved.","authors":"Dawei Zhang; Daniel Sando; Pankaj Sharma; Xuan Cheng; Fan Ji; Vivasha Govinden; Matthew Weyland; Valanoor Nagarajan; Jan Seidel","keywords":"Electronic devices; Ferroelectrics and multiferroics; Information storage","organization_affiliated":"School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; Monash Centre for Electron Microscopy, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia","title":"Superior polarization retention through engineered domain wall pinning","id":"90ac7e90-0bf4-4efd-981c-fb8d60c6790f"}
{"abstract":"The effect of IFN-α on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is not fully understood. We previously reported that intratumoral IFN-α gene transduction decreased the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor by inducing the secretion of IL-6 from dendritic cells. In this study, we examined whether IFN-α affects the trafficking of Tregs to the tumor. Since CT26 cells expressed CCL17 among Treg-attracting chemokines, we focused on its role in IFN-α-mediated Treg suppression. IFN-α directly suppressed CCL17 production from CT26 cells in vitro, and IFN-α transduction reduced CCL17 expression in tumors in vivo. Next, to investigate whether CCL17 downregulation is related to the suppression of Treg trafficking, CCL17-downregulated CT26 cells produced using short hairpin RNA (CT26-shCCL17) were inoculated into mice. The frequency of Tregs in CT26-shCCL17 tumors was reduced and tumor growth was suppressed. Finally, to examine the combinatorial effect of IFN-α expression with CCL17 downregulation, IFN-α was transduced into CT26-shCCL17 tumors. This resulted in an elevation of CT26-specific CD8+ T cells and the complete eradication of tumors. This study shows a novel mechanism of IFN-α-mediated Treg suppression, and combining IFN-α gene therapy with strong CCL17 downregulation could offer a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer.","authors":"Aya Hirata; Hisayoshi Hashimoto; Chihiro Shibasaki; Kenta Narumi; Kazunori Aoki","keywords":"Immunosuppression; Tumour immunology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Immune Medicine, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Japan; Division of Respiratory Medicine, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Mitaka city, Japan; Department of Immune Medicine, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Japan; Department of Immune Medicine, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Japan; Department of Immune Medicine, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Japan; Department of Immune Medicine, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Chuo-ku, Japan","title":"Intratumoral IFN-α gene delivery reduces tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells through the downregulation of tumor CCL17 expression","id":"a597c0d1-aa5b-4a95-8f6a-f62c977280bc"}
{"abstract":"Viruses are present in the intestinal microflora and are currently discussed as a potential causative mechanism for the development of inflammatory bowel disease. A number of viruses, such as Human Herpesvirus-8, express homologs to cellular FLIPs, which are major contributors for the regulation of epithelial cell death. In this study we analyzed the consequences of constitutive expression of HHV8-viral FLIP in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in mice. Surprisingly, expression of vFlip disrupts tissue homeostasis and induces severe intestinal inflammation. Moreover vFlipIEC-tg mice showed reduced Paneth cell numbers, associated with excessive necrotic cell death. On a molecular level vFlip expression altered classical and alternative NFκB activation. Blocking of alternative NFκB signaling by deletion of Ikka in vivo largely protected mice from inflammation and Paneth cell loss induced by vFLIP. Collectively, our data provide functional evidence that expression of a single viral protein in IECs can be sufficient to disrupt epithelial homeostasis and to initiate chronic intestinal inflammation.","authors":"Barbara Ruder; Vinay Murtadak; Michael Stürzl; Stefan Wirtz; Ute Distler; Stefan Tenzer; Mousumi Mahapatro; Florian R.

{"abstract":"Dysfunctional breathing is the main cause of morbidity and mortality after traumatic injury of the cervical spinal cord1,2 and often necessitates assisted ventilation, thus stressing the need to develop strategies to restore breathing. Cervical interneurons that form synapses on phrenic motor neurons, which control the main inspiratory muscle, can modulate phrenic motor output and diaphragmatic function3–5. Here, using a combination of pharmacogenetics and respiratory physiology assays in different models of spinal cord injury, we show that mid-cervical excitatory interneurons are essential for the maintenance of breathing in mice with non-traumatic cervical spinal cord injury, and are also crucial for promoting respiratory recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury. Although these interneurons are not necessary for breathing under normal conditions, their stimulation in non-injured animals enhances inspiratory amplitude. Immediately after spinal cord injury, pharmacogenetic stimulation of cervical excitatory interneurons restores respiratory motor function. Overall, our results demonstrate a strategy to restore breathing after central nervous system trauma by targeting a neuronal subpopulation. A population of cervical interneurons is identified that can regulate diaphragm function by modulating phrenic motor neurons; targeting this small population of neurons may be a functional strategy to restore breathing after traumatic spinal cord injury.","authors":"Kajana Satkunendrarajah; Spyridon K.

{"abstract":"The purpose of this methodological study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a recently developed deep-learning-based image recognition method, to determine corneal ulcer severity in dogs. The CNN model was trained with images for which corneal ulcer severity (normal, superficial, and deep) were previously classified by veterinary ophthalmologists’ diagnostic evaluations of corneal photographs from patients who visited the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) at Konkuk University and 3 different veterinary ophthalmology specialty hospitals in Korea. The original images (depicting normal corneas (36) and corneas with superficial (47) ulcers, deep (47) ulcers), flipped images (total 520), rotated images (total 520), and both flipped and rotated images (total 1,040) were labeled, learned and evaluated with GoogLeNet, ResNet, and VGGNet models, and the severity of each corneal ulcer image was determined. To accomplish this task, models based on TensorFlow, an open-source software library developed by Google, were used, and the labeled images were converted into TensorFlow record (TFRecord) format. The models were fine-tuned using a CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset and then used to predict severity. Most of the models achieved accuracies of over 90% when classifying superficial and deep corneal ulcers, and ResNet and VGGNet achieved accuracies over 90% for classifying normal corneas, corneas with superficial ulcers, and corneas with deep ulcers. This study proposes a method to effectively determine corneal ulcer severity in dogs by using a CNN and concludes that multiple image classification models can be used in the veterinary field.","authors":"Joon Young Kim; Ha Eun Lee; Yeon Hyung Choi; Suk Jun Lee; Jong Soo Jeon","keywords":"Animal physiology; Mechanical engineering","organization_affiliated":"Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Business Administration, College of Business, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Business Administration, College of Business, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"CNN-based diagnosis models for canine ulcerative keratitis","id":"c17d9ff5-0706-4672-a754-701df0827dcd"}
{"abstract":"This study investigated the role of carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) as a morphological marker of the response of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) patients to tadalafil, one of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I). Through March–December 2016, 51 men with vasculogenic ED aged over 30 years were enrolled in this prospective study. Vasculogenic ED was accepted as a normal testosterone level, with penile colour Doppler ultrasonography showing arteriogenic ED, venogenic ED or mixed arteriogenic and venogenic ED. All patients underwent biochemical and hormonal blood tests, ultrasonographic evaluation of the common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and penile colour Doppler ultrasonography. On-demand tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg in cases of a non-response to 10 mg) was administered to each patient for 2 months. ED was assessed using the short form of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) before and after the drug therapy. According to the patients’ responses to the medication, they were grouped as non-responders or responders. Thirty-one of the 51 patients responded to tadalafil. The mean CCA IMT of the non-responders and responders was 0.9 ± 0.2 mm and 0.6 ± 0.2 mm, respectively (P = 0.000). The IMT of 90% of the non-responders was \u003e0.67 mm, whereas it was \u003e0.67 mm in 40% of the responders. The data were analysed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Chi-square test, t-test, Mann–Whitney U test and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Measurement of CCA IMT may offer an alternative and simple method to predict the response of vasculogenic ED patients to PDE5-Is.","authors":"Eyyup Sabri Pelit; Dilek Şen Dokumacı; Bülent Kati; İsmail Yağmur; Erkan Arslan; Adem Tunçtekin; Atakan Kırteke; Halil Çiftçi; Ercan Yeni","keywords":"Reproductive signs and symptoms; Sexual dysfunction","organization_affiliated":"Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Harran University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Urology, Sanliurfa, Turkey","title":"Carotid artery intima-media thickness can predict the response of patients with erectile dysfunction to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors","id":"826dfbef-29c6-4107-aa5e-d9c2cba95060"}
{"abstract":"We report a high spatial resolution mass spectrometry (MS) system that allows us to image live hippocampal tissue slices under open-air atmospheric pressure (AP) and ambient temperature conditions at the subcellular level. The method is based on an efficient desorption process by femtosecond (fs) laser assisted with nanoparticles and a subsequent ionization step by applying nonthermal plasma, termed AP nanoparticle and plasma assisted laser desorption ionization (AP-nanoPALDI) MS method. Combining the AP-nanoPALDI with microscopic sample scanning, MS imaging with spatial resolution of 2.9 µm was obtained. The observed AP-nanoPALDI MS imaging clearly revealed the differences of molecular composition between the apical and basal dendrite regions of a hippocampal tissue. In addition, the AP-nanoPALDI MS imaging showed the decrease of cholesterol in hippocampus by treating with methyl β-cyclodextrin, which exemplifies the potential of AP-nanoPALDI for live tissue imaging for various biomedical applications without any chemical pretreatment and/or labeling process. Ambient mass spectrometry-based approaches have found application in biology and medicine. Here the authors report a mass spectrometric imaging method (ambient nanoPALDI) for live hippocampal tissues, based on gold nanorodassisted femtosecond laser desorption and subsequent non-thermal plasma induced ionization.","authors":"Jae Young Kim; Eun Seok Seo; Hyunmin Kim; Ji-Won Park; Dong-Kwon Lim; Dae Won Moon","keywords":"Mass spectrometry; Molecular neuroscience","organization_affiliated":"Department of New Biology, DGIST, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Department of New Biology, DGIST, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Companion Diagnostics and Medical Technology Research Group, DGIST, Daegu, Republic of Korea; Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology (GRAST), Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of New Biology, DGIST, Daegu, Republic of Korea","title":"Atmospheric pressure mass spectrometric imaging of live hippocampal tissue slices with subcellular spatial resolution","id":"fbe00d67-8bc2-478d-92c2-871af76c0c51"}
{"abstract":"Emerging evidence indicates that the long noncoding RNAs extensively participate in cancer progression. Nevertheless, the molecular pathogenesis of how these lncRNAs regulate tumorigenesis has not been fully elucidated especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we sought to define the role of a novel lncRNA named lncRNA-NEF in modulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. It was found that the lncRNA-NEF was transcriptionally activated by EMT suppressor FOXA2 and frequently downregulated in HCC cell lines as well as clinical specimens. Although enhanced expression of lncRNA-NEF did not affect tumor cell growth, ectopic expression of lncRNA-NEF significantly suppressed EMT program and cell migration. Animal studies validated that lncRNA-NEF alleviated in vivo tumor metastasis and protected mice from tumor-induced mortality. Interestingly, we verified that lncRNA-NEF acted as a novel activator of its neighbor gene FOXA2, which formed a positive feedback loop. Subsequent studies revealed that lncRNA-NEF physically interacted with β-catenin to increase the binding of GSK3β with β-catenin and therefore promoted the inhibitory phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to the suppression on Wnt/β-catenin signaling and activation of FOXA2 expression. Hence, our findings illustrated a novel feedback loop including FOXA2 and its neighboring gene lncRNA-NEF, which might provide mechanistic insights into the metastatic progress of HCC.","authors":"Wei-Cheng Liang; Jia-Lin Ren; Cheuk-Wa Wong; Sun-On Chan; Mary Miu-Yee Waye; Wei-Ming Fu; Jin-Fang Zhang","keywords":"Cancer genomics; Targeted therapies","organization_affiliated":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; The Nethersole School of Nursing, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China; Key Laboratory of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, The First Clinical Medical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, PR China","title":"LncRNA-NEF antagonized epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis via cis-regulating FOXA2 and inactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling","id":"ce216e8c-26b1-4101-a662-d1f035216804"}
{"abstract":"Employing CO2-based polymer in electronic applications should boost the consumption of CO2 feedstocks and provide the potential for non-permanent CO2 storage. In this study, polypropylene carbonate (PPC) is utilized as a dielectric and substrate material for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic inverter. The PPC dielectric film exhibits a surface energy of 47 mN m−1, a dielectric constant of 3, a leakage current density of less than 10−6 A cm−2, and excellent compatibility with pentacene and PTCDI-C8 organic semiconductors. Bottom-gate top-contact OTFTs are fabricated using PPC as a dielectric; they exhibits good electrical performance at an operating voltage of 60 V, with electron and hole mobilities of 0.14 and 0.026 cm2 V−1 s−1, and on-to-off ratios of 105 and 103, respectively. The fabricated p- and n-type transistors were connected to form a complementary inverter that operated at supply voltages of 20 V with high and low noise margins of 85 and 69%, respectively. The suitability of PPC as a substrate is demonstrated through the preparation of PPC sheets by casting method. The fabricated PPC sheets has a transparency of 92% and acceptable mechanical properties, yet they biodegraded rapidly through enzymatic degradation when using the lipase from Rhizhopus oryzae.","authors":"Cut Rullyani; Chao-Feng Sung; Hong-Cheu Lin; Chih-Wei Chu","keywords":"Electronic devices; Electronics, photonics and device physics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan (ROC); Department of Photonics and Display Institute, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan (ROC); Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan (ROC); Research Center for Applied Science Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan (ROC); College of Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan (ROC)","title":"Flexible Organic Thin Film Transistors Incorporating a Biodegradable CO 2 -Based Polymer as the Substrate and Dielectric Material","id":"0ae763cf-0ca1-42cc-a7e1-bfb672d1895e"}
{"abstract":"Regeneration of corneal stroma has always been a challenge due to its sophisticated structure and keratocyte-fibroblast transformation. In this study, we fabricate grid poly (ε-caprolactone)-poly (ethylene glycol) microfibrous scaffold and infuse the scaffold with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel to obtain a 3 D fiber hydrogel construct; the fiber spacing is adjusted to fabricate optimal construct that simulates the stromal structure with properties most similar to the native cornea. The topological structure (3 D fiber hydrogel, 3 D GelMA hydrogel, and 2 D culture dish) and chemical factors (serum, ascorbic acid, insulin, and β-FGF) are examined to study their effects on the differentiation of limbal stromal stem cells to keratocytes or fibroblasts and the phenotype maintenance, in vitro and in vivo tissue regeneration. The results demonstrate that fiber hydrogel and serum-free media synergize to provide an optimal environment for the maintenance of keratocyte phenotype and the regeneration of damaged corneal stroma. Regeneration of corneal stroma has been a challenge due to its sophisticated structure and the easy transformation of the keratocyte. Here, the authors use a hydrogel reinforced with orthogonally aligned fibres and serum free medium to maintain keratocyte phenotype for the in vivo stromal regeneration.","authors":"Bin Kong; Yun Chen; Rui Liu; Xi Liu; Changyong Liu; Zengwu Shao; Liming Xiong; Xianning Liu; Wei Sun; Shengli Mi","keywords":"Gels and hydrogels; Tissue engineering","organization_affiliated":"Macromolecular Platforms for Translational Medicine and Bio-Manufacturing Laboratory, Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen, P.R.

{"abstract":"Ultra-thin Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) were produced by means of an industrial inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) based process. Two families of SiNWs have been identified, namely long SiNWs (up to 2–3 micron in length) and shorter ones (~100 nm). SiNWs were found to consist of a Si core (with diameter as thin as 2 nm) and a silica shell, of which the thickness varies from 5 to 20 nm. By combining advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, we demonstrate that the growth of the long SiNWs occurred via the Oxide Assisted Growth (OAG) mechanism, while the Vapor Liquid Solid (VLS) mechanism is responsible for the growth of shorter ones. Energy filtered TEM analyses revealed, in some cases, the existence of chapelet-like Si nanocrystals embedded in an otherwise silica nanowire. Such nanostructures are believed to result from the exposure of some OAG SiNWs to high temperatures prevailing inside the reactor. Finally, the intense photoluminescence (PL) of these ICP-grown SiNWs in the 620–950 nm spectral range is a clear indication of the occurrence of quantum confinement. Such a PL emission is in accordance with the TEM results which revealed that the size of nanostructures are indeed below the exciton Bohr radius of silicon.","authors":"M. Agati; G. Amiard; V.

{"abstract":"Current medications inadequately treat the symptoms of chronic pain experienced by over 50 million people in the United States, and may come with substantial adverse effects signifying the need to find novel treatments. One novel therapeutic target is the Transient Receptor Potential A1 channel (TRPA1), an ion channel that mediates nociception through calcium influx of sensory neurons. Drug discovery still relies heavily on animal models, including zebrafish, a species in which TRPA1 activation produces hyperlocomotion. Here, we investigated if this hyperlocomotion follows zebrafish TRPA1 pharmacology and evaluated the strengths and limitations of using TRPA1-mediated hyperlocomotion as potential preclinical screening tool for drug discovery. To support face validity of the model, we pharmacologically characterized mouse and zebrafish TRPA1 in transfected HEK293 cells using calcium assays as well as in vivo. TRPA1 agonists and antagonists respectively activated or blocked TRPA1 activity in HEK293 cells, mice, and zebrafish in a dose-dependent manner. However, our results revealed complexities including partial agonist activity of TRPA1 antagonists, bidirectional locomotor activity, receptor desensitization, and off-target effects. We propose that TRPA1-mediated hyperlocomotion in zebrafish larvae has the potential to be used as in vivo screening tool for novel anti-nociceptive drugs but requires careful evaluation of the TRPA1 pharmacology.","authors":"Mee Jung Ko; Logan C.

{"abstract":"The dynamic protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions of integral bitopic membrane proteins with a single membrane-spanning helix play a plethora of vital roles in the cellular processes associated with human health and diseases, including signaling and enzymatic catalysis. While an increasing number of high-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins have successfully manifested an in-depth understanding of their biological functions, intact membrane-bound bitopic protein-protein complexes pose tremendous challenges for structural studies by crystallography or solution NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing approaches to investigate the functional interactions of bitopic membrane proteins embedded in lipid bilayers at atomic-level. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) magic-angle-spinning NMR techniques, along with a judiciously designed stable isotope labeling scheme, to measure atomistic-resolution transmembrane-transmembrane interactions of full-length mammalian ~72-kDa cytochrome P450-cytochrome b5 complex in lipid bilayers. Additionally, the DNP sensitivity-enhanced two-dimensional 13C/13C chemical shift correlations via proton driven spin diffusion provided distance constraints to characterize protein-lipid interactions and revealed the transmembrane topology of cytochrome b5. The results reported in this study would pave ways for high-resolution structural and topological investigations of membrane-bound full-length bitopic protein complexes under physiological conditions.","authors":"Kazutoshi Yamamoto; Marc A.

{"abstract":"Cheap and sensitive gamma-ray detectors are desired for defence, medical and research applications. Solid-state gamma-radiation detectors made from solution-grown perovskites have now been demonstrated for multiple practical applications. The decay of the majority of radioactive isotopes involves the emission of gamma (γ) photons with energies of ∼50 keV to 10 MeV. Detectors of such hard radiation that are low-cost, highly sensitive and operate at ambient temperatures are desired for numerous applications in defence and medicine, as well as in research1,2. We demonstrate that 0.3–1 cm solution-grown single crystals (SCs) of semiconducting hybrid lead halide perovskites (MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and I-treated MAPbBr3, where MA = methylammonium and FA = formamidinium) can serve as solid-state gamma-detecting materials. This possibility arises from a high charge-carrier mobility–lifetime (μτ) product of 1.0–1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1, a low dark carrier density of 109–1011cm−3 (refs 3,4), a low density of charge traps of 109–1010 cm−3 (refs 4,5) and a high absorptivity of hard radiation by the lead and iodine atoms. We demonstrate the utility of perovskite detectors for testing the radiopurity of medical radiotracer compounds such as 18F-fallypride. Energy-resolved sensing at room temperature is presented using FAPbI3 SCs and an 241Am source.","authors":"Sergii Yakunin; Dmitry N.

{"abstract":"Transcription is a highly dynamic process that generates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the genome as ‘transcription bubbles’. Here we describe a kethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing (KAS-seq) approach, based on the fast and specific reaction between N3-kethoxal and guanines in ssDNA. KAS-seq allows rapid (within 5 min), sensitive and genome-wide capture and mapping of ssDNA produced by transcriptionally active RNA polymerases or other processes in situ using as few as 1,000 cells. KAS-seq enables definition of a group of enhancers that are single-stranded and enrich unique sequence motifs. These enhancers are associated with specific transcription-factor binding and exhibit more enhancer–promoter interactions than typical enhancers do. Under conditions that inhibit protein condensation, KAS-seq uncovers a rapid release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from a group of promoters. KAS-seq thus facilitates fast and accurate analysis of transcription dynamics and enhancer activities simultaneously in both low-input and high-throughput manner. KAS-seq applies N3-kethoxal to label guanines along single-stranded DNA in live cells, enabling characterization of ssDNA-involved transcription dynamics with as little as 1,000 cells.","authors":"Tong Wu; Ruitu Lyu; Qiancheng You; Chuan He","keywords":"Chemical tools; DNA; DNA sequencing","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA","title":"Kethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing captures global transcription dynamics and enhancer activity in situ","id":"69b6cc40-ee5c-4318-81f3-44a5e98c7349"}

{"abstract":"Many leguminous species have adapted their seed coat with a layer of powdery bloom that contains hazardous allergens and makes the seeds less visible, offering duel protection against potential predators 1 . Nevertheless, a shiny seed surface without bloom is desirable for human consumption and health, and is targeted for selection under domestication. Here we show that seed coat bloom in wild soybeans is mainly controlled by Bloom1 (B1), which encodes a transmembrane transporter-like protein for biosynthesis of the bloom in pod endocarp. The transition from the ‘bloom’ to ‘no-bloom’ phenotypes is associated with artificial selection of a nucleotide mutation that naturally occurred in the coding region of B1 during soybean domestication. Interestingly, this mutation not only ‘shined’ the seed surface, but also elevated seed oil content in domesticated soybeans. Such an elevation of oil content in seeds appears to be achieved through b1-modulated upregulation of oil biosynthesis in pods. This study shows pleiotropy as a mechanism underlying the domestication syndrome 2 , and may pave new strategies for development of soybean varieties with increased seed oil content and reduced seed dust. The seed coat of many leguminous species has a powdery bloom containing hazardous allergens. In wild soybeans, the bloom is controlled by the BLOOM1 gene, a mutation in which abolishes bloom and elevates seed oil content in domesticated strains.","authors":"Dajian Zhang; Lianjun Sun; Shuai Li; Weidong Wang; Yanhua Ding; Stephen A.

{"abstract":"Early studies indicated that testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) could function as a suppressor in the transcriptional regulation of the HBV core gene expression, which might then influence the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The direct linkage between TR4 and HCC progression, however, remained unclear. Here, via a human clinical sample survey, we found that 13 of the 18 HCC patients studied had lower TR4 expression in metastatic lesions than in matched primary HCC lesions, suggesting that TR4 may play a negative role in HCC metastasis. Results from in vitro cell migration/invasion studied confirmed that TR4 could suppress HCC cell migration/invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that TR4 might function through downregulating ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) expression at the transcriptional level via direct binding to the TR4REs located on the 5′ promoter of EphA2 to suppress HCC cell migration/invasion. Targeting the EphA2 via EphA2-siRNA partially reversed the enhanced HCC cell migration/invasion with confirmed TR4 knockdown. Notably, results from preclinical studies using in vivo mouse model with orthotopic xenograft of HCC LM3 cells also confirmed the in vitro findings. Taking these findings together, preclinical studies using multiple in vitro HCC cell lines and an in vivo mouse model all led to the conclusion that TR4 may function as a suppressor of HCC metastasis and that targeting this newly identified TR4-EphA2 signaling may improve our ability to suppress HCC metastasis.","authors":"Ren’an Jin; Hui Lin; Gonghui Li; Junjie Xu; Liang Shi; Chawnshang Chang; Xiujun Cai","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Departments of Pathology and Urology and The Wilmot Cancer Center, George Whipple Lab for Cancer Research, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, USA; Chawnshang Chang Liver Cancer Center, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine and Innovation Center for Minimally Invasive Technique and Device, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","title":"TR 4 nuclear receptor suppresses HCC cell invasion via downregulating the EphA2 expression","id":"8395d795-e45c-47c8-9773-a53b662ccd24"}
{"abstract":"Apoptosis is a cell death process generally described as involving a cascade of caspase activation, death receptors and/or pro- and antiapoptotic molecules from the BcL-2 family. But about 20 years ago, a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway has been described. Regarding this pathway, we can learn a lot from Leishmania parasites. Indeed, these parasitic protozoa enter, in response to different stimuli, in a form of cell death phenotypically similar to mammalian apoptosis but without involving caspases or death receptors. So far, only two proteins have been clearly identified as being involved in Leishmania-regulated cell death: the metacaspase and the endonuclease G. We report here the identification of a new protein modeled as a potential hydrolase, highly conserved among Leishmania species and absent in the very close parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This protein is involved in L. major-regulated cell death induced by curcumin, miltefosine and pentamidine, after gene overexpression and/or protein translocation to the nucleus. The identification of proteins involved in Leishmania-regulated cell death will provide a better understanding of nonconventional apoptotic pathways in higher eukaryotes. It will also allow the development of new therapeutic tools via the identification of new specific targets.","authors":"Louise Basmaciyan; Pauline Jacquet; Nadine Azas; Magali Casanova","keywords":"Apoptosis; Parasitic infection","organization_affiliated":"UMR PAM A, Valmis team, Dijon Cedex, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, MEPHI, Marseille, France; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France","title":"A novel hydrolase with a pro-death activity from the protozoan parasite Leishmania major","id":"59e0370a-61e4-46b3-9ab7-39fdb2d2feb7"}
{"abstract":"Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and parkinsonian disorders. However, the relationship between plasma NFL and cognitive decline in dementia due to Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains to be elucidated. In this research, 119 AD, 56 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 26 non-demented PD (PDND), and 23 Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) patients, as well as 59 cognitively healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Each subject underwent a battery of neuropsychological testing. Plasma NFL levels were measured in duplicate using an NF-Light assay and transferred onto the Simoa platform with a home-brew kit. Plasma NFL was significantly increased in the AD group, compared with the control, MCI, PDND, and PDD groups. Plasma NFL was significantly higher in the PDD group, compared with the PDND group. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition in AD and PD, but not with motor symptoms in PD. Plasma NFL may represent a biomarker of cognitive decline in AD and PD, with more specificity for AD.","authors":"Yung-Shuan Lin; Wei-Ju Lee; Shuu-Jiun Wang; Jong-Ling Fuh","keywords":"Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive ageing; Neural ageing","organization_affiliated":"Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Neurological Institute, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Dementia and Parkinson’s Disease Integrated Center, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Brain Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Brain Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Brain Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Levels of plasma neurofilament light chain and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer or Parkinson disease","id":"d760e44b-77a8-4654-9f42-d7c6dd504fc5"}
{"abstract":"Pepper species (Capsicum spp.) are widely used as food, spice, decoration, and medicine. Despite the recent old-world culinary impact, more than 50 commercially recognized pod types have been recorded worldwide from three taxonomic complexes (A, B, and P). The current study aimed to apply a pan-plastome approach to resolve the plastomic boundaries among those complexes and identify effective loci for the taxonomical resolution and molecular identification of the studied species/varieties. High-resolution pan-plastomes of five species and two varieties were assembled and compared from 321 accessions. Phyloplastomic and network analyses clarified the taxonomic position of the studied species/varieties and revealed a pronounced number of accessions to be the rare and endemic species, C. galapagoense, that were mistakenly labeled as C. annuum var. glabriusculum among others. Similarly, some NCBI-deposited plastomes were clustered differently from their labels. The rpl23-trnI intergenic spacer contained a 44 bp tandem repeat that, in addition to other InDels, was capable of discriminating the investigated Capsicum species/varieties. The rps16-trnQ/rbcL-accD/ycf3-trnS gene set was determined to be sufficiently polymorphic to retrieve the complete phyloplastomic signal among the studied Capsicum spp. The pan-plastome approach was shown to be useful in resolving the taxonomical complexes, settling the incomplete lineage sorting conflict and developing a molecular marker set for Capsicum spp. identification.","authors":"Mahmoud Magdy; Lijun Ou; Huiyang Yu; Rong Chen; Yuhong Zhou; Heba Hassan; Bihong Feng; Nathan Taitano; Esther van der Knaap; Xuexiao Zou; Feng Li; Bo Ouyang","keywords":"Agricultural genetics; Comparative genomics; Genetic markers; Phylogenomics","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Genetics Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt; College of Horticulture and Landscape, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning, China; Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture \u0026 Environmental Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, USA; Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture \u0026 Environmental Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, USA; College of Horticulture and Landscape, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology (Ministry of Education), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China","title":"Pan-plastome approach empowers the assessment of genetic variation in cultivated Capsicum species","id":"c9f99377-fb23-4c51-9c0e-84f10f7e476e"}
{"abstract":"CD32 has been shown to be preferentially expressed in latently HIV-1-infected cells in an in vitro model of quiescent CD4 T cells. Here we show that stimulation of CD4+ T cells with IL-2, IL-7, PHA, and anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies induces T-cell proliferation, co-expression of CD32 and the activation of the markers HLA-DR and CD69. HIV-1 infection increases CD32 expression. 79.2% of the CD32+/CD4+ T cells from HIV+ individuals under antiretroviral treatment were HLA-DR+. Resting CD4+ T cells infected in vitro generally results in higher integration of provirus. We observe no difference in provirus integration or replication-competent inducible latent HIV-1 in CD32+ or CD32− CD4+ T cells from HIV+ individuals. Our results demonstrate that CD32 expression is a marker of CD4+ T cell activation in HIV+ individuals and raises questions regarding the immune resting status of CD32+ cells harboring HIV-1 proviruses. CD32 has been previously shown to be expressed preferentially by CD4 T cells latently harbouring HIV-1.

{"abstract":"New synthetic biology capabilities hold the promise of dramatically improving our ability to engineer biological systems. However, a fundamental hurdle in realizing this potential is our inability to accurately predict biological behavior after modifying the corresponding genotype. Kinetic models have traditionally been used to predict pathway dynamics in bioengineered systems, but they take significant time to develop, and rely heavily on domain expertise. Here, we show that the combination of machine learning and abundant multiomics data (proteomics and metabolomics) can be used to effectively predict pathway dynamics in an automated fashion. The new method outperforms a classical kinetic model, and produces qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be used to productively guide bioengineering efforts. This method systematically leverages arbitrary amounts of new data to improve predictions, and does not assume any particular interactions, but rather implicitly chooses the most predictive ones. New synthetic biology capabilities (e.g. CRISPR) dramatically improve our ability to engineer biological systems for the benefit of society (biofuels, medical drugs). However, this effort is hampered because we cannot reliably predict the outcome of our bioengineering efforts. Mathematical kinetic models have been traditionally used to predict pathway dynamics, but they take a long time to develop and require significant biological expertize. Here, we substitute traditional kinetic models with a machine learning approach that is able to learn pathway dynamics straight from data examples. This new approach can be systematically applied to any product, pathway or host and significantly speeds up bioengineering.","authors":"Zak Costello; Hector Garcia Martin","keywords":"Dynamical systems; Metabolic engineering; Synthetic biology; Time series","organization_affiliated":"Biological Systems and Engineering Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA; DOE Agile Biofoundry, Emeryville, USA; DOE Joint BioEnergy Institute, Emeryville, USA; Biological Systems and Engineering Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA; DOE Agile Biofoundry, Emeryville, USA; DOE Joint BioEnergy Institute, Emeryville, USA; BCAM, Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, Bilbao, Spain","title":"A machine learning approach to predict metabolic pathway dynamics from time-series multiomics data","id":"5c2503f5-0073-44fd-97b9-b27fbf453ef2"}
{"abstract":"The non-isochemical crystallization of glasses leads to glass-ceramics in which the chemical composition of the amorphous matrix differs from that of the parent glass. It is challenging to solely analyse the properties of these residual glassy phases because they frequently contain finely dispersed crystals. In this study, the composition of the residual glass matrix after the crystallization of a glass with the mol% composition 50.6 SiO2 · 20.7 MgO · 20.7 Al2O3 · 5.6 ZrO2 · 2.4 Y2O3 is analysed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) including energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXS). A batch of the residual glass with the determined composition is subsequently melted and selected properties are analysed. Furthermore, the crystallization behaviour of this residual glass is studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy including electron backscatter diffraction and STEM-EDXS analyses. The residual glass shows sole surface crystallization of indialite and multiple yttrium silicates while bulk nucleation does not occur. This is in contrast to the crystallization behaviour of the parent glass, in which a predominant bulk nucleation of spinel and ZrO2 is observed. The crystallization of the residual glass probably leads to different crystalline phases when it is in contact to air, rather than when it is enclosed within the microstructure of the parent glass-ceramics.","authors":"Sabrina Seidel; Christian Patzig; Wolfgang Wisniewski; Antje Gawronski; Yongfeng Hu; Thomas Höche; Christian Rüssel","keywords":"Chemistry; Materials science","organization_affiliated":"Otto Schott Institut, Jena University, Jena, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for the Microstructure of Materials and Systems IMWS, Halle, Germany; Otto Schott Institut, Jena University, Jena, Germany; Otto Schott Institut, Jena University, Jena, Germany; Canadian Light Source Inc., University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada; Fraunhofer Institute for the Microstructure of Materials and Systems IMWS, Halle, Germany; Otto Schott Institut, Jena University, Jena, Germany","title":"Characterizing the residual glass in a MgO/Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 /ZrO 2 /Y 2 O 3 glass-ceramic","id":"1e13a2fb-ff12-43f3-adf2-219866eb53e5"}

In general, the rich phenomenology of these systems depends directly on the molecular traits and conditions of the system, imposing precise symmetry to the resulting nematic field. By selecting amyloid fibrils as model filamentous chiral colloids, we report an unprecedented breadth of liquid crystalline morphologies, where up to six distinct configurations of the nematic field are observed under identical conditions. Amyloid-rich droplets show homogeneous, bipolar, radial, uniaxial chiral and radial chiral nematic fields, with additional parabolic focal conics in bulk. Variational and scaling theories allow rationalizing the experimental evidence as a subtle interplay between surface and bulk energies.

{"abstract":"Nipah virus is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes deadly encephalitis and respiratory infections in humans. Two glycoproteins coordinate the infection of host cells, an attachment protein (G), which binds to cell surface receptors, and a fusion (F) protein, which carries out the process of virus-cell membrane fusion. The G protein binds to ephrin B2/3 receptors, inducing G conformational changes that trigger F protein refolding. Using an optical approach based on second harmonic generation, we show that monomeric and dimeric receptors activate distinct conformational changes in G. The monomeric receptor-induced changes are not detected by conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies or through electron microscopy analysis of G:ephrinB2 complexes. However, hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments confirm the second harmonic generation observations and reveal allosteric changes in the G receptor binding and F-activating stalk domains, providing insights into the pathway of receptor-activated virus entry. Nipah virus causes encephalitis in humans. Here the authors use a multidisciplinary approach to study the binding of the viral attachment protein G to its host receptor ephrinB2 and show that monomeric and dimeric receptors activate distinct conformational changes in G and discuss implications for receptor-activated virus entry.","authors":"Joyce J.

{"abstract":"We present an approach for fabrication of reproducible, chemically and mechanically robust functionalized layers based on MgF2 thin films on thin glass substrates. These show great advantages for use in super-resolution microscopy as well as for multi-electrode-array fabrication and are especially suited for combination of these techniques. The transparency of the coated substrates with the low refractive index material is adjustable by the layer thickness and can be increased above 92%. Due to the hydrophobic and lipophilic properties of the thin crystalline MgF2 layers, the temporal stable adhesion needed for fixation of thin tissue, e.g. cryogenic brain slices is given. This has been tested using localization-based super-resolution microscopy with currently highest spatial resolution in light microscopy. We demonstrated that direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy revealed in reliable imaging of structures of central synapses by use of double immunostaining of post- (homer1 and GluA2) and presynaptic (bassoon) marker structure in a 10 µm brain slice without additional fixing of the slices. Due to the proven additional electrical insulating effect of MgF2 layers, surfaces of multi-electrode-arrays were coated with this material and tested by voltage-current-measurements.

{"abstract":"The Landau level laser was proposed long ago as a unique source of monochromatic radiation that would be widely tunable in the THz and infrared spectral ranges using a magnetic field. However, despite many efforts, this appealing concept never progressed to the design of a reliable device. This is because of the efficient Auger scattering of Landau-quantized electrons, an intrinsic non-radiative recombination channel that eventually gains over cyclotron emission in all materials studied so far (conventional semiconductors with parabolic bands, but also in graphene with massless electrons). Auger processes are favoured in these systems because the Landau levels (or their subsets) are equally spaced in energy. Here, we show that this scheme does not apply to massless Kane electrons in gapless HgCdTe, where undesirable Auger scattering is strongly suppressed and sizeable cyclotron emission is observed. The gapless HgCdTe thus appears as a material of choice for future Landau level lasers. Lasers based on Landau levels, which should offer wide wavelength tunability, including across the elusive THz range, are a step closer to reality with a demonstration showing how to suppress the main loss mechanism.","authors":"D.

{"abstract":"Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is potentially linked with development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1-4. BCAA transaminase 2 (BCAT2) was essential for the collateral lethality conferred by deletion of malic enzymes in PDAC and the BCAA–BCAT metabolic pathway contributed to non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) other than PDAC3,4. However, the underlying mechanism remains undefined. Here we reveal that BCAT2 is elevated in mouse models and in human PDAC. Furthermore, pancreatic tissue-specific knockout of Bcat2 impedes progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) in LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice. Functionally, BCAT2 enhances BCAA uptake to sustain BCAA catabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Notably, BCAA enhances growth of pancreatic ductal organoids from KC mice in a dose-dependent manner, whereas addition of branched-chain α-keto acid (BCKA) and nucleobases rescues growth of KC organoids that is suppressed by BCAT2 inhibitor. Moreover, KRAS stabilizes BCAT2, which is mediated by spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and E3 ligase tripartite-motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). In addition, BCAT2 inhibitor ameliorates PanIN formation in KC mice. Of note, a lower-BCAA diet also impedes PDAC development in mouse models of PDAC. Thus, BCAT2-mediated BCAA catabolism is critical for development of PDAC harbouring KRAS mutations. Targeting BCAT2 or lowering dietary BCAA may have translational significance. Li et al. show that BCAA transaminase 2 enhances uptake and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, thereby promoting development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harbouring KRAS mutations.","authors":"Jin-Tao Li; Miao Yin; Di Wang; Jian Wang; Ming-Zhu Lei; Ye Zhang; Ying Liu; Lei Zhang; Shao-Wu Zou; Li-Peng Hu; Zhi-Gang Zhang; Yi-Ping Wang; Wen-Yu Wen; Hao-Jie Lu; Zheng-Jun Chen; Dan Su; Qun-Ying Lei","keywords":"Cancer; Cancer metabolism; Pancreatic cancer","organization_affiliated":"Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of National Health Commission, XiangYa Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China; Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital, Tong Ji University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital and Key Laboratory Diagnosis and Treatment Technology on Thoracic Oncology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Cancer Metabolism Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","title":"BCAT2-mediated BCAA catabolism is critical for development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","id":"4d971514-6a96-4d0d-bfc2-f4acb9fe00a2"}
{"abstract":"Compared with whites, blacks develop hypertension earlier in life, progress from prehypertension to hypertension at an accelerated rate, and exhibit greater hypertension-mediated organ damage (e.g., kidney disease, stroke). In this paper, we tested whether the longitudinal associations between elevated systolic blood pressure and disruption of brain white matter structural integrity differ as a function of race. A community sample of 100 middle-aged adults with prehypertension underwent diffusion imaging to quantify indirect metrics of white matter structural integrity, including fractional anisotropy. Blood pressure and diffusion imaging measurements were collected at baseline and at a 2-year follow-up. Regression analyses showed that higher systolic blood pressure at baseline was associated with a decrease in fractional anisotropy over 2 years in blacks only (β = −0.51 [95% CI = −0.85, −0.16], t = −2.93, p = 0.004, ΔR2 = 0.09).

{"abstract":"We prospectively investigated the changes in choroidal blood flow and morphology after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in 39 eyes with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (S-NPDR). Seventeen eyes underwent PRP by conventional laser and 22 eyes underwent pattern scan laser (PASCAL). The choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser speckle flowgraphy, and the subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured with optical coherence tomography before and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the two types of PRP treatments. The choroidal mean blur rate (MBR) at the macular region was significantly reduced to 86.4% of the baseline level in the conventional laser group and 85.7% in the PASCAL group at Week 12 (P = 0.001, P \u003c 0.001, respectively). The SFCT was significantly increased at 1 week following PRP but it was significantly reduced at Week 8 (P = 0.001, P \u003c 0.001, respectively) in both groups. The differences in the ratio of the MBR and the SFCT was not significant between the conventional laser and PASCAL groups at any time after PRP. The results suggest that appropriate PRP treatments even by the PASCAL method will reduce the choroidal blood flow and the choroidal morphological components.","authors":"Yuji Mikoshiba; Takeshi Iwase; Yoshitaka Ueno; Kentaro Yamamoto; Eimei Ra; Hiroko Terasaki","keywords":"Outcomes research; Retinal diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan","title":"A randomized clinical trial evaluating choroidal blood flow and morphology after conventional and pattern scan laser panretinal photocoagulation","id":"af857407-b958-4dfe-b0cc-7ba65f771d76"}
{"abstract":"Embryonic mammary cells are a unique population comprised of undifferentiated, highly plastic progenitor cells that create normal mammary tissues. The mammary gland continues to develop after birth from descendants of embryonic mammary cells. Here, we establish cell lines from mouse mammary organs, immediately after they formed during prenatal development, to facilitate studies of primitive mammary cells, which are difficult to isolate in sufficient quantities for use in functional experiments. We show that some lines can be induced to secrete milk, a distinguishing feature of mammary epithelial cells. Targeted deletion of Sox9, from one clone, decreases the ability to respond to lactogenic stimuli, consistent with a previously identified role for Sox9 in regulating luminal progenitor function. Sox9 ablation also leads to alterations in 3D morphology and downregulation of Zeb1, a key epithelial–mesenchymal transition regulator. Prenatal mammary cell lines are an invaluable resource to study regulation of mammary progenitor cell biology and development. Naoko Kogata et al. generated murine mammary progenitor cell lines that form spheres and secrete milk upon hormonal stimulation. Deletion of Sox9 increased the ability of these cells to forms spheres but decreased milk production induced by lactogenic stimuli, consistent with the role of this transcription factor on maintaining the stem cell state.","authors":"Naoko Kogata; Philip Bland; Mandy Tsang; Erik Oliemuller; Anne Lowe; Beatrice A.

{"abstract":"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor. The prognosis of metastatic and recurrent OS patients still remains unsatisfactory. Cisplatin reveals undeniable anti-tumor effect while induces severe side effects that threatening patients’ health. Dynasore, a cell-permeable small molecule that inhibits dynamin activity, has been widely studied in endocytosis and phagocytosis. However, the anti-tumor effect of dynasore on OS has not yet been ascertained. In the present study, we suggested that dynasore inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced G0/G1 arrest of OS cells. Besides, dynasore repressed tumorigenesis of OS in xenograft mouse model. In addition, we demonstrated that dynasore improved the anti-tumor effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo without inducing nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Mechanistically, dynasore repressed the expression of CCND1, CDK4, p-Rb, and MMP-2. Furthermore, we found that dynasore exerts anti-tumor effects in OS partially via inhibiting STAT3 signaling pathway but not ERK-MAPK, PI3K-Akt or SAPK/JNK pathways. P38 MAPK pathway served as a negative regulatory mechanism in dynasore induced anti-OS effects. Taken together, our study indicated that dynasore does suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via STAT3 signaling pathway, and enhances the antitumor capacity of cisplatin in OS. Our results suggest that dynasore is a novel candidate drug to inhibit the tumor growth of OS and enhance the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin.","authors":"Binlong Zhong; Deyao Shi; Fashuai Wu; Shangyu Wang; Hongzhi Hu; Cheng Cheng; Xiangcheng Qing; Xin Huang; Xueying Luo; Zhicai Zhang; Zengwu Shao","keywords":"Bone cancer; Drug development; Drug discovery","organization_affiliated":"Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan Mental Health Centre, Wuhan Hospital for Psychotherapy, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","title":"Dynasore suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and enhances the antitumor capacity of cisplatin via STAT3 pathway in osteosarcoma","id":"8a3a3646-ee16-4345-8710-792df63808c9"}
{"abstract":"With \u003e70,000 yearly publications using mouse data, mouse models represent the best engrained research system to address numerous biological questions across all fields of science. Concerns of poor study and microbiome reproducibility also abound in the literature. Despite the well-known, negative-effects of data clustering on interpretation and study power, it is unclear why scientists often house \u003e4 mice/cage during experiments, instead of ≤2. We hypothesized that this high animal-cage-density  practice abounds in published literature because more mice/cage could be perceived as a strategy to reduce housing costs. Among other sources of ‘artificial’ confounding, including cyclical oscillations of the ‘dirty-cage/excrement microbiome’, we ranked by priority the heterogeneity of modern husbandry practices/perceptions across three professional organizations that we surveyed in the USA. Data integration (scoping-reviews, professional-surveys, expert-opinion, and ‘implementability-score-statistics’) identified Six-Actionable Recommendation Themes (SART) as a framework to re-launch emerging protocols and intuitive statistical strategies to use/increase study power. ‘Cost-vs-science’ discordance was a major aspect explaining heterogeneity, and scientists’ reluctance to change. With a ‘housing-density cost-calculator-simulator’ and fully-annotated statistical examples/code, this themed-framework streamlines the rapid analysis of cage-clustered-data and promotes the use of ‘study-power-statistics’ to self-monitor the success/reproducibility of basic and translational research. Examples are provided to help scientists document analysis for study power-based sample size estimations using preclinical mouse data to support translational clinical trials, as requested in NIH/similar grants or publications.","authors":"Abigail R.

{"abstract":"We have proposed a high temperature die attach method with porous Ag sheet as an interlayer for power device packaging. Sn-3.5Ag solder paste can infiltrate into the porous Ag sheet through capillary forces and Sn can react with the porous Ag sheet and Ag metallizations at the interfaces to form Ag3Sn after reflow at 260 °C for 10 min. The large specific surface area and the high diffusion rates between Ag and Sn accelerate the Sn consumption in the porous Ag structure, thus significantly reducing the processing time. The difference of the melting points of the die attach material before and after reflow could be expanded as large as 259 °C. The bondlines show good electrical and thermal conductivities. Furthermore, the average shear strength of the bondlines at 300 °C is higher than 20 MPa. The porous Ag skeleton remained in the bondline would contribute greatly to the heat dissipation and the electrical signal transmission in power devices.","authors":"Chunjin Hang; Junjian He; Zhihao Zhang; Hongtao Chen; Mingyu Li","keywords":"Electronic devices; Mechanical engineering","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China; Fujian Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Materials, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China","title":"Low Temperature Bonding by Infiltrating Sn3.5Ag Solder into Porous Ag Sheet for High Temperature Die Attachment in Power Device Packaging","id":"33c984e0-b23f-4e86-be32-84e60b1b6caf"}
{"abstract":"Sensitivity is a crucial parameter for flexible pressure sensors and electronic skins. While introducing microstructures (e.g., micro-pyramids) can effectively improve the sensitivity, it in turn leads to a limited pressure-response range due to the poor structural compressibility. Here, we report a strategy of engineering intrafillable microstructures that can significantly boost the sensitivity while simultaneously broadening the pressure responding range. Such intrafillable microstructures feature undercuts and grooves that accommodate deformed surface microstructures, effectively enhancing the structural compressibility and the pressure-response range. The intrafillable iontronic sensor exhibits an unprecedentedly high sensitivity (Smin \u003e 220 kPa−1) over a broad pressure regime (0.08 Pa-360 kPa), and an ultrahigh pressure resolution (18 Pa or 0.0056%) over the full pressure range, together with remarkable mechanical stability. The intrafillable structure is a general design expected to be applied to other types of sensors to achieve a broader pressure-response range and a higher sensitivity. Though flexible pressure sensors are attractive for next-generation applications, limitations in its performance hinder widespread adoption. Here, the authors report an iontronic flexible pressure sensor with graded intrafillable architecture that shows high sensitivity over a broad pressure range.","authors":"Ningning Bai; Liu Wang; Qi Wang; Jue Deng; Yan Wang; Peng Lu; Jun Huang; Gang Li; Yuan Zhang; Junlong Yang; Kewei Xie; Xuanhe Zhao; Chuan Fei Guo","keywords":"Biomedical engineering; Mechanical engineering","organization_affiliated":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen Engineering Research Center for Novel Electronic Information Materials and Devices, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China","title":"Graded intrafillable architecture-based iontronic pressure sensor with ultra-broad-range high sensitivity","id":"5f721acd-b2dd-4ee1-97a9-d2013568e3f1"}
{"abstract":"Photonic-based qubits and integrated photonic circuits have enabled demonstrations of quantum information processing (QIP) that promises to transform the way in which we compute and communicate. To that end, sources of polarization-entangled photon pair states are an important enabling technology. However, such states are difficult to prepare in an integrated photonic circuit. Scalable semiconductor sources typically rely on nonlinear optical effects where polarization mode dispersion (PMD) degrades entanglement. Here, we directly generate polarization-entangled states in an AlGaAs waveguide, aided by the PMD and without any compensation steps. We perform quantum state tomography and report a raw concurrence as high as 0.91 ± 0.01 observed in a 1,100-nm-wide waveguide. The scheme allows direct Bell state generation with an observed maximum fidelity of 0.90 ± 0.01 from another (800-nm-wide) waveguide. Our demonstration paves the way for sources that allow for the implementation of polarization-encoded protocols in large-scale quantum photonic circuits.","authors":"Pisek Kultavewuti; Eric Y.

{"abstract":"The phosphatase calcineurin targets NFAT transcription factors in T cells. Ashwell and colleagues show that calcineurin is recruited to the TCR signaling complex, where it reverses the inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase Lck. Calcineurin is a phosphatase whose primary targets in T cells are NFAT transcription factors, and inhibition of calcineurin activity by treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK506 is a cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapies. Here we found that calcineurin was recruited to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling complex, where it reversed inhibitory phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Lck on Ser59 (LckS59). Loss of calcineurin activity impaired phosphorylation of Tyr493 of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (ZAP-70Y493), as well as some downstream pathways in a manner consistent with signaling in cells expressing LckS59A (Lck that cannot be phosphorylated) or LckS59E (a phosphomimetic mutant). Notably, CsA inhibited integrin-LFA-1-dependent and NFAT-independent adhesion of T cells to the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1, with little effect on cells expressing mutant Lck. These results provide new understanding of how widely used immunosuppressive drugs interfere with essential processes in the immune response.","authors":"Debjani Dutta; Valarie A Barr; Itoro Akpan; Paul R Mittelstadt; Laishram I Singha; Lawrence E Samelson; Jonathan D Ashwell","keywords":"Signal transduction; T-cell receptor","organization_affiliated":"Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA; Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA; Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA; Present address: Department of Biotechnology, St. Anthony's College, Shillong, India., ; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA; Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA","title":"Recruitment of calcineurin to the TCR positively regulates T cell activation","id":"fc788a31-e2a9-4e21-b37d-2bf77a4ec748"}
{"abstract":"To identify the unusual climate conditions and their connections to air pollutions in a remote area due to wildfires, we examine three anomalous large-scale wildfires in May 2003, April 2008, and July 2014 over East Eurasia, as well as how products of those wildfires reached an urban city, Sapporo, in the northern part of Japan (Hokkaido), significantly affecting the air quality. NASA’s MERRA-2 (the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) aerosol re-analysis data closely reproduced the PM2.5 variations in Sapporo for the case of smoke arrival in July 2014. Results show that all three cases featured unusually early snowmelt in East Eurasia, accompanied by warmer and drier surface conditions in the months leading to the fires, inducing long-lasting soil dryness and producing climate and environmental conditions conducive to active wildfires. Due to prevailing anomalous synoptic-scale atmospheric motions, smoke from those fires eventually reached a remote area, Hokkaido, and worsened the air quality in Sapporo. In future studies, continuous monitoring of the timing of Eurasian snowmelt and the air quality from the source regions to remote regions, coupled with the analysis of atmospheric and surface conditions, may be essential in more accurately predicting the effects of wildfires on air quality.","authors":"Teppei J.

{"abstract":"In natural ionic solids, cationic and anionic species are alternately arranged to minimize electrostatic energy. Aggregation of identical ionic species is commonly prohibited due to the repulsive, long-range nature of Coulombic interactions. Recently, we synthesized unique ionic solids, [AuI4CoIII2(dppe)2(d-pen)4]X2·nH2O (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, d-pen = d-penicillaminate), in which complex cations are self-assembled into a cationic supramolecular octahedron, while monovalent or divalent inorganic anions are aggregated into an anomalous anionic cluster accommodating several water molecules. This quite unusual aggregation manner originates from various molecular-level non-Coulombic interactions such as hydrogen bonds and CH-π interactions; thus, this class of ionic solids is referred to as non-Coulombic ionic solids, abbreviated as NCISs. Herein, we report that the NCISs with a peculiar charge-separated (CS) structure in a cubic lattice show a negative, isotropic electrostriction phenomenon that has never been found in any ionic solids, as well as an anomalously large relaxer-like dielectric jump phenomenon reaching to an application level of ε′/ε0 ~ 105. The appearance of these phenomena was explained by the cooperative dynamics of inorganic anions and dipolar water molecules in the pliable anionic clusters that are surrounded by a rather robust cationic metallosupramolecular framework with a meso-scopic scale.","authors":"Satoshi Yamashita; Yasuhiro Nakazawa; Shusuke Yamanaka; Mitsutaka Okumura; Tatsuhiro Kojima; Nobuto Yoshinari; Takumi Konno","keywords":"Electronics, photonics and device physics; Organic–inorganic nanostructures; Physical chemistry; Solid-state chemistry","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machinakeyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan","title":"Dielectric Jump and Negative Electrostriction in Metallosupramolecular Ionic Crystals","id":"44a2802e-753d-4a8e-9d38-2ab90a6091ce"}
{"abstract":"Overcoming the global health threat of HIV infection requires continuous pipelines of novel drug candidates. We identified the γ-pyrone polyketides Aureothin/Neoaureothin as potent hits by anti-HIV screening of an extensive natural compound collection. Total synthesis of a structurally diverse group of Aureothin-derivatives successfully identified a lead compound (#7) superior to Aureothin that combines strong anti-HIV activity (IC90\u003c45 nM), photostability and improved cell safety. Compound #7 inhibited de novo virus production from integrated proviruses by blocking the accumulation of HIV RNAs that encode the structural components of virions and include viral genomic RNAs. Thus, the mode-of-action displayed by compound #7 is different from those of all current clinical drugs. Proteomic analysis indicated that compound #7 does not affect global protein expression in primary blood cells and may modulate cellular pathways linked to HIV infection. Compound #7 inhibited multiple HIV genotypes, including HIV-type 1 and 2 and synergistically inhibited HIV in combination with clinical reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. We conclude that compound #7 represents a promising new class of HIV inhibitors that will facilitate the identification of new virus-host interactions exploitable for antiviral attack and holds promise for further drug development.","authors":"Alexander Herrmann; Manfred Roesner; Thomas Werner; Stefanie M.

As shown by confocal immunofluorescence, CD44/ERα double-labeled cells were mainly expressed in the basal cell and suprabasal cell layers. Immunofluorescent staining of CD44 was expressed in the plasma membrane of the vaginal epithelium, and ERα was expressed in the cytoplasm of the vaginal epithelium. The CD44/ERα double-positive cells were noted in the rat vagina by flow cytometric analysis. PR-labeled cells were localized in the intermediate layer of the epithelial space of the vagina. The results revealed the existence of EPCs in the vagina.

{"abstract":"Spermatogenesis is the complex process of male germline development and requires coordinated interactions by multiple gene products that undergo strict developmental regulations. Increasing evidence has suggested that a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may function as important regulatory molecules in various physiological and pathological processes by binding to specific proteins. Here, we identified a subset of QKI-5-binding lncRNAs in the mouse testis through the integrated analyses of RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-microarray and biological verification. Among the lncRNAs, we revealed that NONMMUT074098.2 (Lnc10), which was highly expressed in the spermatogonia and spermatocytes of the testis, interacted with QKI-5. Furthermore, Lnc10 depletion promoted germ cell apoptosis via the activation of p38 MAPK, whereas the simultaneous knockdown of QKI-5 could rescue the apoptotic phenotype and the activation of p38 MAPK, which were induced by the loss of Lnc10. These data indicated that the Lnc10-QKI-5 interaction was associated with the regulatory roles of QKI-5 and that the Lnc10-QKI-5 interaction inhibited the regulation of QKI-5 on the downstream p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Additionally, we functionally characterized the biological roles of Lnc10 and found that the knockdown of Lnc10 promoted the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in vivo; this suggested that Lnc10 had an important biological role in mouse spermatogenesis. Thus, our study provides a potential strategy to investigate the biological significance of lncRNA-RBP interactions during male germline development.","authors":"Kai Li; Shunshun Zhong; Yanyun Luo; Dingfeng Zou; Mengzhen Li; Yahui Li; Yan Lu; Shiying Miao; Linfang Wang; Wei Song","keywords":"Long non-coding RNAs; Spermatogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China","title":"A long noncoding RNA binding to QKI-5 regulates germ cell apoptosis via p38 MAPK signaling pathway","id":"48bd4b6c-e433-42cc-a9d0-881876d483e0"}
{"abstract":" Owing to the limited operating space available, robot-assisted approaches have been rapidly adopted for procedures involving the retroperitoneal space. In this Review the authors describe the outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted procedures, including partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, nephroureterectomy and adrenalectomy, in addition to the potential of novel techniques. Robot assistance has been rapidly adopted by urological surgeons and has become particularly popular for oncological procedures involving the retroperitoneal space. The wide dissemination of robot assistance probably reflects the limited amount of operating space available within the retroperitoneum and the advantages provided by robot-assisted approaches, including 3D imaging, wristed instrumentation and the shorter learning curve compared with that associated with the equivalent laparoscopic techniques. Surgical procedures that have traditionally been performed using an open or laparoscopic approach, such as partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, nephroureterectomy and adrenalectomy, are now often being performed using robot assistance. The frontiers of robot-assisted retroperitoneal oncological surgery are constantly expanding, with an emphasis on maintaining oncological and functional outcomes, while minimizing the level of surgical invasiveness.","authors":"Wesley W.

{"abstract":"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of genomic polymorphisms and are widely used in population genetics research. Here, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the genome-level diversity, population structure, and relationships of apricot, which are important for germplasm conservation and molecular breeding. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was adopted to sequence 168 Prunus spp. accessions distributed in five ecological groups, including 74 accessions of cultivated Prunus armeniaca L. and 94 accessions of wild apricots (P. armeniaca L. and Prunus sibirica L.), which generated 417,961 high-quality SNPs. We used cluster, genetic structure, and principal component analyses to examine the genetic diversities and genetic relationships of the 168 accessions. The Dzhungar-Ili ecological group accessions showed the highest genetic diversity in terms of private allele number, observed heterozygosity, and nucleotide diversity. We speculate that the Central Asian ecological group accessions were domesticated from the Dzhungar-Ili ecological group accessions. The population structure and gene flow of the North China and European ecological group accessions suggested a genetic background of P. sibirica. We argue that the two groups should be considered hybrid swarms connected to P. sibirica by continuous and extensive gene flow. P. armeniaca originated in Northwest China (Ili Valley), subsequently spread throughout Central Asia, and eventually spread to Europe. In addition, selective sweep signatures in P. armeniaca during domestication from wild to cultivated apricots, combined with differentially expressed genes, underlie distinct fruit traits, including sugars, aromas, organic acids, and carotenoids. This study provides substantive and valuable genomic resources that will significantly advance apricot improvement and effective utilization.","authors":"Wenwen Li; Liqiang Liu; Yanan Wang; Qiuping Zhang; Guoquan Fan; Shikui Zhang; Yatong Wang; Kang Liao","keywords":"Comparative genomics; Genome evolution","organization_affiliated":"College of Horticulture and Forestry, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi, China; College of Horticulture and Forestry, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi, China; College of Horticulture and Forestry, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi, China; Xiongyue National Germplasm Resources Garden of the Liaoning Institute of Pomology, Xiongyue, China; Luntai National Fruit Germplasm Resources Garden of Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Luntai, China; Luntai National Fruit Germplasm Resources Garden of Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Luntai, China; Luntai National Fruit Germplasm Resources Garden of Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Luntai, China; College of Horticulture and Forestry, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi, China","title":"Genetic diversity, population structure, and relationships of apricot ( Prunus ) based on restriction site-associated DNA sequencing","id":"ea2811ae-9f1b-41e8-b81d-0b66e629a7b3"}
{"abstract":"Determining the shape of plant cellulose microfibrils is critical for understanding plant cell wall molecular architecture and conversion of cellulose into biofuels. Only recently has it been determined that these cellulose microfibrils are composed of 18 cellulose chains rather than 36 polymers arranged in a diamond-shaped pattern. This study uses density functional theory calculations to model three possible habits for the 18-chain microfibril and compares the calculated energies, structures, 13C NMR chemical shifts and WAXS diffractograms of each to evaluate which shape is most probable. Each model is capable of reproducing experimentally-observed data to some extent, but based on relative theoretical energies and reasonable reproduction of all variables considered, a microfibril based on 5 layers in a 34443 arrangement is predicted to be the most probable. A habit based on a 234432 arrangement is slightly less favored, and a 6 × 3 arrangement is considered improbable.","authors":"James D.

{"abstract":"Although the roles of the Hippo pathway in organogenesis and tumorigenesis have been well studied in multiple organs, its role in sperm maturation and male fertility has not been investigated. The initial segment (IS) of the epididymis plays a critical role in sperm maturation. IS differentiation is governed by ERK1/2, but the mechanisms of ERK1/2 activation in IS are not fully understood. Here we show that double knockout (dKO) of mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2), homologs of Hippo in Drosophila, in the epididymal epithelium led to male infertility in mice. Sperm in the cauda epididymides of mutant mice were immotile with flagellar angulation and severely disorganized structures. Loss of Mst1/2 activated YAP and increased proliferation and cell death in all the segments of epididymis. The mutant mice showed substantially suppressed MEK/ERK signaling in the IS and failed IS differentiation. Deletion of Yap restored the reduced MEK/ERK signaling, and partially rescued the defective IS differentiation and fertility in Mst1/2 dKO mice. Our results demonstrate that YAP inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway in IS epithelial cells, and MST1/2 control IS differentiation and fertility at least partially by repressing YAP. Taken together, the Hippo pathway is essential for sperm maturation and male fertility.","authors":"Chenling Meng; Geng Tian; Chunhua Xu; Xiaofeng Li; Yu Zhang; Yang Wang; Jinzhong Qin; Ellis Kin Lam Fok; Barry T.

{"abstract":"In B lymphopoiesis, activation of the pre-B cell antigen receptor (pre-BCR) is associated with both cell cycle exit and Igk recombination. Yet how the pre-BCR mediates these functions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the pre-BCR initiates a feed-forward amplification loop mediated by the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 and the chemokine receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). CXCR4 ligation by C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, which then directs the development of small pre- and immature B cells, including orchestrating cell cycle exit, pre-BCR repression, Igk recombination and BCR expression. In contrast, pre-BCR expression and escape from interleukin-7 have only modest effects on B cell developmental transcriptional and epigenetic programs. These data show a direct and central role for CXCR4 in orchestrating late B cell lymphopoiesis. Furthermore, in the context of previous findings, our data provide a three-receptor system sufficient to recapitulate the essential features of B lymphopoiesis in vitro. Pre-B cells undergo a transition checkpoint needed for developmental progression. Mandal and colleagues show that the CXCL12–CXCR4 signaling axis orchestrates late B cell lymphopoiesis by suppressing Myc and cyclin D genes and promoting Rag-mediated recombination of immunoglobulin light-chain genes.","authors":"Malay Mandal; Michael K.

{"abstract":"The electrochemical intercalation of layered materials, particularly graphite, is fundamental to the operation of rechargeable energy-storage devices such as the lithium-ion battery and the carbon-enhanced lead-acid battery. Intercalation is thought to proceed in discrete stages, where each stage represents a specific structure and stoichiometry of the intercalant relative to the host. However, the three-dimensional structures of the stages between unintercalated and fully intercalated are not known, and the dynamics of the transitions between stages are not understood. Using optical and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we video the intercalation of single microcrystals of graphite in concentrated sulfuric acid. Here we find that intercalation charge transfer proceeds through highly variable current pulses that, although directly associated with structural changes, do not match the expectations of the classical theories. Evidently random nanoscopic defects dominate the dynamics of intercalation. The common lithium-ion battery is re-charged by intercalating its graphite anode, but intercalation remains not well understood. Electron microscope video of intercalating graphite microcrystals reveals that the charge transfer occurs in current pulses that do not match theoretical expectations.","authors":"Edward R.

{"abstract":"Current protocols for ancient DNA and radiocarbon analysis of ancient bones and teeth call for multiple destructive samplings of a given specimen, thereby increasing the extent of undesirable damage to precious archaeological material. Here we present a method that makes it possible to obtain both ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon dates from the same sample material. This is achieved by releasing DNA from the bone matrix through incubation with either EDTA or phosphate buffer prior to complete demineralization and collagen extraction utilizing the acid-base-acid-gelatinization and ultrafiltration procedure established in most radiocarbon dating laboratories. Using a set of 12 bones of different ages and preservation conditions we demonstrate that on average 89% of the DNA can be released from sample powder with minimal, or 38% without any, detectable collagen loss. We also detect no skews in radiocarbon dates compared to untreated samples. Given the different material demands for radiocarbon dating (500 mg of bone/dentine) and DNA analysis (10–100 mg), combined DNA and collagen extraction not only streamlines the sampling process but also drastically increases the amount of DNA that can be recovered from limited sample material.","authors":"Petra Korlević; Sahra Talamo; Matthias Meyer","keywords":"Archaeology; Evolutionary biology; Next-generation sequencing; Palaeontology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany","title":"A combined method for DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating from a single sample","id":"21ea058b-4a70-496b-9a92-bdbd7665ffa8"}
{"abstract":"Fully printed wearable electronics based on two-dimensional (2D) material heterojunction structures also known as heterostructures, such as field-effect transistors, require robust and reproducible printed multi-layer stacks consisting of active channel, dielectric and conductive contact layers. Solution processing of graphite and other layered materials provides low-cost inks enabling printed electronic devices, for example by inkjet printing. However, the limited quality of the 2D-material inks, the complexity of the layered arrangement, and the lack of a dielectric 2D-material ink able to operate at room temperature, under strain and after several washing cycles has impeded the fabrication of electronic devices on textile with fully printed 2D heterostructures. Here we demonstrate fully inkjet-printed 2D-material active heterostructures with graphene and hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) inks, and use them to fabricate all inkjet-printed flexible and washable field-effect transistors on textile, reaching a field-effect mobility of ~91 cm2 V−1 s−1, at low voltage (\u003c5 V). This enables fully inkjet-printed electronic circuits, such as reprogrammable volatile memory cells, complementary inverters and OR logic gates. Heterojunction structures based on 2D materials show promise for wearable and textile electronics. Here, the authors demonstrate fully inkjet-printed hetero junctions of graphene and h-BN as a platform for FET-based smart electronics on wearable and washable textile substrates.","authors":"Tian Carey; Stefania Cacovich; Giorgio Divitini; Jiesheng Ren; Aida Mansouri; Jong M.

{"abstract":"IClswell is the chloride current induced by cell swelling, and plays a fundamental role in several biological processes, including the regulatory volume decrease (RVD). ICln is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed and multifunctional protein involved in the activation of IClswell. In platelets, ICln binds to the intracellular domain of the integrin αIIb chain, however, whether the ICln/integrin interaction plays a role in RVD is not known. Here we show that a direct molecular interaction between ICln and the integrin α-chain is not restricted to platelets and involves highly conserved amino acid motifs. Integrin α recruits ICln to the plasma membrane, thereby facilitating the activation of IClswell during hypotonicity. Perturbation of the ICln/integrin interaction prevents the transposition of ICln towards the cell surface and, in parallel, impedes the activation of IClswell. We suggest that the ICln/integrin interaction interface may represent a new molecular target enabling specific IClswell suppression in pathological conditions when this current is deregulated or plays a detrimental role.","authors":"Andreas Schedlbauer; Grazia Tamma; Simona Rodighiero; Davide Antonio Civello; Margherita Tamplenizza; Karin Ledolter; Charity Nofziger; Wolfgang Patsch; Robert Konrat; Markus Paulmichl; Silvia Dossena","keywords":"Patch clamp; Protein–protein interaction networks","organization_affiliated":"Department of Structural and Computational Biology, Max F.

{"abstract":"Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), an important food-borne pathogenic microorganism, has resistance immune function to many commonly used drugs. Myristic acid is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, but it has been rarely used as a food additive, limiting the development of natural food preservatives. In this study, the antibacterial activity and mechanism of myristic acid against L. monocytogenes were studied. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of myristic acid against 13 L. monocytogenes strains ranged from 64 to 256 μg ml−1. The time-kill assay demonstrated that when myristic acid was added to dairy products, flow cytometry confirmed that myristic acid influenced cell death and inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and NPN uptake studies illustrated that myristic acid changed the bacterial morphology and membrane structure of L. monocytogenes, which led to rapid cell death. Myristic acid could bind to DNA and lead to changes in DNA conformation and structure, as identified by fluorescence spectroscopy. Our studies provide additional evidence to support myristic acid being used as a natural antibacterial agent and also further fundamental understanding of the modes of antibacterial action.","authors":"Xiangrong Chen; Xingchen Zhao; Yanhong Deng; Xiujuan Bu; Haiqing Ye; Na Guo","keywords":"Bacteriology; Drug development","organization_affiliated":"Department of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun Shi, China; Department of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Tonghua Normal University, Tonghua, China; Animal Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun Shi, China; Department of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun Shi, China; Department of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun Shi, China; Department of Food Quality and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun Shi, China","title":"Antimicrobial potential of myristic acid against Listeria monocytogenes in milk","id":"f653e381-7085-4653-bc66-d42e68b65187"}

Along these lines and, to potentially realize hydrogen-bond mediated superexchange interactions in a frustrated material, we synthesized [H2F]2[Ni3F6(Fpy)12][SbF6]2 (Fpy = 3-fluoropyridine). It was found that positionally-disordered H2F+ ions link neutral NiF2(Fpy)4 moieties into a kagome lattice with perfect 3-fold rotational symmetry. Detailed magnetic investigations combined with density-functional theory (DFT) revealed weak antiferromagnetic interactions (J ~ 0.4 K) and a large positive-D of 8.3 K with ms = 0 lying below ms = ±1. The observed weak magnetic coupling is attributed to bond-disorder of the H2F+ ions which leads to disrupted Ni-F···H-F-H···F-Ni exchange pathways. Despite this result, we argue that networks such as this may be a way forward in designing tunable materials with varying degrees of frustration.","authors":"Jamie L. Manson; Jamie Brambleby; Paul A.

{"abstract":"A small number of case–control studies have suggested that mitochondrial haplogroups could be associated with obesity. We examined whether obesity risk was influenced by mitochondrial haplogroup in a large North American cohort across an 8-year period. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study including individuals from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Mitochondrial haplogroups were determined by sequencing and PCR-RFLP techniques using this nomenclature: HV, JT, KU, IWX, and super HV/others. The strength of the association between mitochondrial haplogroups and incident obesity was quantified with hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for potential confounders using a Cox’s regression analysis. Overall, 2342 non-obese Caucasian participants (56.7% women) with a mean ± SD age of 62.0 ± 9.5 years at baseline were included. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 334 individuals ( = 14.3% of baseline population) became obese. After adjusting for nine potential confounders, the haplogroups IWX carried a significant 48% higher risk of obesity (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.02–2.39) compared to the HV haplotype (the most frequent type). Only the presence of the IWX haplogroups appears to be linked to increased obesity risk, independent of potential baseline confounders. Future cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine potential underlying mechanisms.","authors":"Nicola Veronese; Brendon Stubbs; Ai Koyanagi; Alberto Vaona; Jacopo Demurtas; Patricia Schofield; Trevor Thompson; Stefania Maggi","keywords":"Biomarkers; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Padova, Italy; Ambulatory of Nutrition, IRCCS “S. de Bellis”, National Institute of Gastroenterology-Research Hospital, Bari, Italy; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King’s College London, London, UK; Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK; Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, Fundació Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain; Primary Care Department, Verona, Italy; Primary Care Department, Azienda USL Toscana Sud Est, Grosseto, Italy; Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK; Faculty of Education and Health, University of Greenwich, London, UK; National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Padova, Italy","title":"Mitochondrial genetic haplogroups and incident obesity: a longitudinal cohort study","id":"b7ced761-8e7b-405f-8a8c-e5e6fa0ca562"}
{"abstract":"OTULIN (OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity) removes linear polyubiquitin from proteins that have been modified by LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) and is critical for preventing auto-inflammatory disease1,2 and embryonic lethality during mouse development3. Here we show that OTULIN promotes rather than counteracts LUBAC activity by preventing its auto-ubiquitination with linear polyubiquitin. Thus, knock-in mice that express catalytically inactive OTULIN, either constitutively or selectively in endothelial cells, resembled LUBAC-deficient mice4 and died midgestation as a result of cell death mediated by TNFR1 (tumour necrosis factor receptor 1) and the kinase activity of RIPK1 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1). Inactivation of OTULIN in adult mice also caused pro-inflammatory cell death. Accordingly, embryonic lethality and adult auto-inflammation were prevented by the combined loss of cell death mediators: caspase 8 for apoptosis and RIPK3 for necroptosis. Unexpectedly, OTULIN mutant mice that lacked caspase 8 and RIPK3 died in the perinatal period, exhibiting enhanced production of type I interferon that was dependent on RIPK1. Collectively, our results indicate that OTULIN and LUBAC function in a linear pathway, and highlight a previously unrecognized interaction between linear ubiquitination, regulators of cell death, and induction of type I interferon. OTULIN, which removes ubiquitin chains deposited by LUBAC, promotes LUBAC activity by preventing its auto-ubiquitination, thereby supporting normal mouse embryo development and preventing pro-inflammatory cell death in adult mice.","authors":"Klaus Heger; Katherine E.

{"abstract":"Cells can sense changes in their extracellular environment and subsequently adapt their biomass composition. Nutrient abundance defines the capability of the cell to produce biomass components. Under nutrient-limited conditions, resource allocation dramatically shifts to carbon-rich molecules. Here, we used dynamic biomass composition data to predict changes in growth and reaction flux distributions using the available genome-scale metabolic models of five eukaryotic organisms (three heterotrophs and two phototrophs). We identified temporal profiles of metabolic fluxes that indicate long-term trends in pathway and organelle function in response to nitrogen depletion. Surprisingly, our calculations of model sensitivity and biosynthetic cost showed that free energy of biomass metabolites is the main driver of biosynthetic cost and not molecular weight, thus explaining the high costs of arginine and histidine. We demonstrated how metabolic models can accurately predict the complexity of interwoven mechanisms in response to stress over the course of growth.","authors":"Juan D.

{"abstract":"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) are aggressive epithelial tumours frequently treated using radiation. HNC biology shows distinctions dependent on the oncologic involvement of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Clinically, HPV positive HNCs respond better to radiotherapy but few in vitro data demonstrate radiobiological differences explaining differences in clinical outcomes. This pilot study examined radiobiological responses to irradiation and subsequent regeneration in two HNC cell lines (HPV positive and negative). A novel approach was taken to develop generational cultures of HNC cell lines, UM-SCC-1 (HPV negative) and UM-SCC-47 (HPV positive). MTT assays were used to determine surviving metabolic activity as a function of dose following 6 MV X-ray irradiation. Parallel cultures surviving 4 Gy irradiation (not analysed) were re-cultured and passaged to develop subsequent generations which were re-irradiated and analysed for generational change in radiation response. Second and 3rd generations of UM-SCC-1 showed decreasing metabolic activity with dose but little difference was evident in surviving fractions between these generations. Significantly lower metabolic activity in the 3rd generation at \u003c6 Gy, compared to the 2nd generation, showed UM-SCC-47 becoming progressively more radiosensitive. HPV positive UM-SCC-47 showed generational progression in radiosensitisation not seen in the HPV negative UM-SCC-1.","authors":"Paul Reid; Puthenparampil Wilson; Yanrui Li; Loredana G.

{"abstract":"X- and gamma-ray detectors have broad applications ranging from medical imaging to security, non-proliferation, high-energy physics and astrophysics. Detectors with high energy resolution, e.g. less than 1.5% resolution at 662 keV at room temperature, are critically important in most uses. The efficacy of adding selenium to the cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) matrix for radiation detector applications has been studied. In this paper, the growth of a new quaternary compound Cd0.9Zn0.1Te0.98Se0.02 by the Traveling Heater Method (THM) is reported. The crystals possess a very high compositional homogeneity with less extended defects, such as secondary phases and sub-grain boundary networks. Virtual Frisch-grid detectors fabricated from as-grown ingots revealed ~0.87–1.5% energy resolution for 662-keV gamma rays. The superior material quality with a very low density of defects and very high compositional homogeneity heightens the likelihood that Cd0.9Zn0.1Te0.98Se0.02 will be the next generation room-temperature detector material.","authors":"Utpal N.

{"abstract":"GLI1 fusions involving ACTB, MALAT1, and PTCH1 genes have been recently reported in a subset of malignant soft tissue tumors with characteristic monomorphic nested epithelioid morphology and frequent S100 positivity. However, we encountered a group of morphologically similar soft tissue tumors lacking the canonical GLI1 gene fusions and sought to investigate their genetic abnormalities. A combined approach including RNA sequencing, targeted exome sequencing and FISH methodologies were used to identify potential novel genetic abnormalities. Ten patients (five females, five males) with an age range of 4–65 years (median 32.5) were identified. Tumors were located in the soft tissues of the limbs, trunk and head and neck, with one each in the tongue and lung. Histologically, tumors revealed ovoid to epithelioid cells arranged in a distinctive nested-trabecular pattern, separated by thin septa and a delicate vascular network. Two cases showed areas of increased nuclear pleomorphism and focal fascicular spindle cell growth. Four tumors showed a high mitotic count (≥15/10 HPFs), with necrosis seen in three of them. Lymphovascular invasion was noted in two cases. No consistent immunoprofile was detected, with positivity for CD56 (six cases), S100 (four cases), SMA (two cases), and pan-CK (one case). FISH showed GLI1 (12q13.3) gene amplification in all 10 cases, with co-amplification of CDK4 (12q14.1) in nine (90%) and MDM2 (12q15) in eight (80%) cases. Targeted exome sequencing performed in three cases confirmed the GLI1, CDK4, and MDM2 co-amplification. Only one case showed the presence of both GLI1 break-apart and amplification, although no gene partner was detected. Our findings suggest that GLI1 amplification, often associated with co-amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2 genes, may represent an alternative genetic mechanism of GLI1 oncogenic activation akin to GLI1 fusions, defining the pathogenesis of an emerging group of malignant soft tissue tumors with a distinctive nested growth pattern and variable immunoprofile.","authors":"Narasimhan P.

{"abstract":"To examine the interrelationship of aging extension and modification of lipid metabolism under chronic caloric restriction (CCR; reduced concentration of the green algae Tetraselmis suecica) in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus, we assessed life cycle parameters, fatty acid composition, and expression of sirtuin and genes related to lipid metabolism. B. koreanus in the 5% T. suecica group showed an increased life span but decreased reproduction. Based on this finding, we chose 5% T. suecica for further experiments and compared the data with those for 100% T. suecica. Upregulation of sirtuin gene expression was observed under CCR. In addition, despite the reduction in the amount of total fatty acid (FA) and the area of triacylglycerol, increases in the ratios of saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) to total FA in 5%-exposed B. koreanus were observed. Furthermore, mRNA expression analysis confirmed that CCR promoted the synthesis of MUFA through Δ9 desaturase. Moreover, expression of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) synthesizing gene Δ4 desaturase was also upregulated, together with DHA content. These data suggest that CCR modified protein acetylation and lipid metabolism, leading to a decrease in reproduction and consequently resulting in life span extension.","authors":"Min-Chul Lee; Jun Chul Park; Deok-Seo Yoon; Jeonghoon Han; Sujin Kang; Shohei Kamizono; Ae-Son Om; Kyung-Hoon Shin; Atsushi Hagiwara; Jae-Seong Lee","keywords":"Ecophysiology; Limnology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Marine Sciences and Convergent Technology, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea; Graduate School of Fisheries and Environmental Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan; Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Human Ecology, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Marine Sciences and Convergent Technology, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea; Graduate School of Fisheries and Environmental Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan; Department of Biological Science, College of Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea","title":"Aging extension and modifications of lipid metabolism in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus under chronic caloric restriction","id":"dc66675e-0136-4608-84b7-50b39103cd3d"}
{"abstract":"Our bodies and the environment constrain our movements. For example, when our arm is fully outstretched, we cannot extend it further. More generally, the distribution of possible movements is conditioned on the state of our bodies in the environment, which is constantly changing. However, little is known about how the brain represents such distributions, and uses them in movement planning. Here, we record from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys reach to randomly placed targets. The hand’s position within the workspace creates probability distributions of possible upcoming targets, which affect movement trajectories and latencies. PMd, but not M1, neurons have increased activity when the monkey’s hand position makes it likely the upcoming movement will be in the neurons’ preferred directions. Across the population, PMd activity represents probability distributions of individual upcoming reaches, which depend on rapidly changing information about the body’s state in the environment. Movements are continually constrained by the current body position and its relation to the surroundings. Here the authors report that the population activity of monkey dorsal premotor cortex neurons dynamically represents the probability distribution of possible reach directions.","authors":"Joshua I.

{"abstract":"Half of all of the elements in the Universe that are heavier than iron were created by rapid neutron capture. The theory underlying this astrophysical r-process was worked out six decades ago, and requires an enormous neutron flux to make the bulk of the elements1. Where this happens is still debated2. A key piece of evidence would be the discovery of freshly synthesized r-process elements in an astrophysical site. Existing models3–5 and circumstantial evidence6 point to neutron-star mergers as a probable r-process site; the optical/infrared transient known as a ‘kilonova’ that emerges in the days after a merger is a likely place to detect the spectral signatures of newly created neutron-capture elements7–9. The kilonova AT2017gfo—which was found following the discovery of the neutron-star merger GW170817 by gravitational-wave detectors10—was the first kilonova for which detailed spectra were recorded. When these spectra were first reported11,12, it was argued that they were broadly consistent with an outflow of radioactive heavy elements; however, there was no robust identification of any one element. Here we report the identification of the neutron-capture element strontium in a reanalysis of these spectra. The detection of a neutron-capture element associated with the collision of two extreme-density stars establishes the origin of r-process elements in neutron-star mergers, and shows that neutron stars are made of neutron-rich matter13. Reanalysis of the spectra associated with the merger of two neutron stars identifies strontium, spectroscopically establishing the origin of the heavy elements created by rapid neutron capture and proving that neutron stars comprise neutron-rich matter.","authors":"Darach Watson; Camilla J.

{"abstract":"Morality evolved within specific social contexts that are argued to shape moral choices. In turn, moral choices are hypothesized to be affected by body odors as they powerfully convey socially-relevant information. We thus investigated the neural underpinnings of the possible body odors effect on the participants’ decisions. In an fMRI study we presented to healthy individuals 64 moral dilemmas divided in incongruent (real) and congruent (fake) moral dilemmas, using different types of harm (intentional: instrumental dilemmas, or inadvertent: accidental dilemmas). Participants were required to choose deontological or utilitarian actions under the exposure to a neutral fragrance (masker) or body odors concealed by the same masker (masked body odor). Smelling the masked body odor while processing incongruent (not congruent) dilemmas activates the supramarginal gyrus, consistent with an increase in prosocial attitude. When processing accidental (not instrumental) dilemmas, smelling the masked body odor activates the angular gyrus, an area associated with the processing of people’s presence, supporting the hypothesis that body odors enhance the saliency of the social context in moral scenarios. These results suggest that masked body odors can influence moral choices by increasing the emotional experience during the decision process, and further explain how sensory unconscious biases affect human behavior.","authors":"Cinzia Cecchetto; Elisa Lancini; Domenica Bueti; Raffaella Ida Rumiati; Valentina Parma","keywords":"Morality; Olfactory cortex; Perception; Sensory processing","organization_affiliated":"SISSA – International School for Advanced Studies, Neuroscience Area, Trieste, Italy; Institute of Psychology, University of Graz, Graz, Austria; BioTechMed, Graz, Austria; SISSA – International School for Advanced Studies, Neuroscience Area, Trieste, Italy; SISSA – International School for Advanced Studies, Neuroscience Area, Trieste, Italy; SISSA – International School for Advanced Studies, Neuroscience Area, Trieste, Italy; ANVUR - Agenzia Nazionale della Valutazione del sistema Universitario e della Ricerca, Via Ippolito Nievo, Roma, Italy; SISSA – International School for Advanced Studies, Neuroscience Area, Trieste, Italy; William James Center for Research, ISPA - Instituto Universitário, Lisboa, Portugal; Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","title":"Body odors (even when masked) make you more emotional: behavioral and neural insights","id":"71ce0077-604a-47b2-b3ad-81d949e6780f"}
{"abstract":"Regular low intensity aerobic exercise (aerobic training) provides effective protection against various metabolic disorders. Here, the roles played by transient transcriptome responses to acute exercise and by changes in baseline gene expression during up-regulation of protein content in human skeletal muscle were investigated after 2 months of aerobic training. Seven untrained males were involved in a 2 month aerobic cycling training program. Mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing were used to evaluate proteome and transcriptome responses to training and acute exercise. We found that proteins with different functions are regulated differently at the transcriptional level; for example, a training-induced increase in the content of extracellular matrix-related proteins is regulated at the transcriptional level, while an increase in the content of mitochondrial proteins is not. An increase in the skeletal muscle content of several proteins (including mitochondrial proteins) was associated with increased protein stability, which is related to a chaperone-dependent mechanism and/or reduced regulation by proteolysis. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of protein expression in human skeletal muscle subjected to repeated stress (long term aerobic training) and may provide an opportunity to control the expression of specific proteins (e.g., extracellular matrix-related proteins, mitochondrial proteins) through physiological and/or pharmacological approaches.","authors":"Pavel A.

{"abstract":"Actomyosin contractility, crucial for several physiological processes including migration, is controlled by the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) are predominant kinases that phosphorylate MLC. However, the distinct roles of these kinases in regulating actomyosin contractility and their subsequent impact on the migration of healthy and malignant skin cells is poorly understood. We observed that blockade of ROCK in healthy primary keratinocytes (HPKs) and epidermal carcinoma cell line (A-431 cells) resulted in loss of migration, contractility, focal adhesions, stress fibres, and changes in morphology due to reduction in phosphorylated MLC levels. In contrast, blockade of MLCK reduced migration, contractile dynamics, focal adhesions and phosphorylated MLC levels of HPKs alone and had no effect on A-431 cells due to the negligible MLCK expression. Using genetically modified A-431 cells expressing phosphomimetic mutant of p-MLC, we show that ROCK dependent phosphorylated MLC controls the migration, focal adhesion, stress fibre organization and the morphology of the cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that ROCK is the major kinase of MLC phosphorylation in both HPKs and A-431 cells, and regulates the contractility and migration of healthy as well as malignant skin epithelial cells.","authors":"Srisathya Srinivasan; Sreya Das; Vishakha Surve; Ankita Srivastava; Sushant Kumar; Nikita Jain; Abhijeet Sawant; Chitra Nayak; Rahul Purwar","keywords":"Cell migration; Myosin","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Plastic Surgery, Topiwala National Medical College \u0026 BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India; Department of Skin and Venereal Diseases, Topiwala National Medical College \u0026 BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences \u0026 Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India","title":"Blockade of ROCK inhibits migration of human primary keratinocytes and malignant epithelial skin cells by regulating actomyosin contractility","id":"c9bf309c-8080-4d24-a9a9-58b5e1498c35"}
{"abstract":"It is commonly accepted that a full bandgap voltage is required to achieving efficient electroluminescence (EL) in organic light-emitting diodes. In this work, we demonstrated organic molecules with a large singlet-triplet splitting can achieve efficient EL at voltages below the bandgap voltage. The EL originates from delayed fluorescence due to triplet fusion. Finally, in spite of a lower quantum efficiency, a blue fluorescent organic light-emitting diode having a power efficiency higher than some of the best thermally activated delayed fluorescent and phosphorescent blue organic light-emitting diodes is demonstrated. The current findings suggest that leveraging triplet fusion from purely organic molecules in organic light-emitting diode materials offers an alternative route to achieve stable and high efficiency blue organic light-emitting diodes. Though organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with electroluminescence at sub-bandgap voltages have been reported, realizing high efficiency in such a device is difficult.

Mouse models with mutations in known causal genes only partially recapitulate the phenotypes and are therefore not unlimitedly suited for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for these conditions2. Here we study periventricular heterotopia (PH) by analyzing cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with mutations in the cadherin receptor–ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 or from isogenic knockout (KO) lines1,3. Our results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knockdown of their expression causes changes in the morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics only in a subset of neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveal a subpopulation of mutant neurons with dysregulated genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration and patterning.

{"abstract":"Gluten-free diet is the lifelong therapy for patients with coeliac disease. A wide range of gluten-free products (GFP) is available, which mimics the characteristics of their gluten-containing counterparts (GCC). The aim of this study was to compare the macronutrient and dietary fibre composition of GFP and GCC currently available in Spain. A cross-sectional study analysing the nutritional differences between 621 GFP and 600 GCC based on labelling information was conducted. Food items were categorized in one of 14 food groups. The first six ingredients were noted for each food item. A linear regression model was used to explain differences in nutritional composition between GFP and GCC and three independent models were created for bread, pasta and biscuits. Results showed that GCC had higher protein content than GFP, especially in flour, bread, pasta and pizza. Bread had higher total and saturated fat contents in the GFP in which palm oil was the main fat used. Flours and starchy ingredients used in GFP formulation were mainly rice and corn flours and corn starch, and palm oil was the most commonly used fat. In conclusion, GFP cannot currently be considered as equivalent substitutes for their GCC. The reformulation of the GFP with more healthy ingredients and ingredients is encouraged, using a healthy oil, pseudocereals and whole flour.","authors":"Joaquim Calvo-Lerma; Paula Crespo-Escobar; Sandra Martínez-Barona; Victoria Fornés-Ferrer; Ester Donat; Carmen Ribes-Koninckx","keywords":"Coeliac disease; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe, Valencia, Spain; Instituto de Ingeniería de Alimentos para el Desarrollo, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe, Valencia, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe, Valencia, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe, Valencia, Spain; Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe.

{"abstract":"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal capable of damaging brain. Studies have demonstrated that Cd can induce apoptosis in neuronal cells. The CD95/APO-1 (Fas)/Fas Ligand (FasL) signaling pathway is one of the primary apoptosis pathways, but the role and regulatory mechanism of this pathway in neuronal cells remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated the underlying mechanism of the Fas/FasL system involving the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in neuronal cells. Primary rat cerebral cortical neurons and PC12 cells were exposed to Cd, which significantly activated expression of Fas, FasL, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and cleaved caspase-8. However, expression of cleaved caspase-8 decreased at 20 µM Cd in primary cerebral cortical neurons. Importantly, Cd-induced apoptotic morphological changes and increase in the apoptosis rate were partially blocked by Z-IETD-FMK, which is a specific inhibitor of caspase-8. Cd-mediated increase of apoptosis rate was inhibited by anti-FasL antibody. Furthermore, our data revealed that Z-IETD-FMK also blocked increase of truncated BH3 interacting domain death agonist (tBID)/BID, decrease of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associate X protein (Bax) ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c, as well as cleavage of caspase-9/3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) induced by Cd. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the Fas/FasL-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway plays an important role in Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis.","authors":"Yan Yuan; Yajing Zhang; Shiwen Zhao; Jie Chen; Jinlong Yang; Tao Wang; Hui Zou; Yi Wang; Jianhong Gu; Xuezhong Liu; Jianchun Bian; Zongping Liu","keywords":"Apoptosis; Environmental impact; Molecular neuroscience","organization_affiliated":"College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, People’s Republic of China","title":"Cadmium-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells is mediated by Fas/FasL-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway","id":"131bbc12-854c-4137-b09d-7bc899df9873"}
{"abstract":"Here we present a new method for automatic and objective monitoring of ingestive behaviors in comparison with other facial activities through load cells embedded in a pair of glasses, named GlasSense. Typically, activated by subtle contraction and relaxation of a temporalis muscle, there is a cyclic movement of the temporomandibular joint during mastication. However, such muscular signals are, in general, too weak to sense without amplification or an electromyographic analysis. To detect these oscillatory facial signals without any use of obtrusive device, we incorporated a load cell into each hinge which was used as a lever mechanism on both sides of the glasses. Thus, the signal measured at the load cells can detect the force amplified mechanically by the hinge. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept validation of the amplification by differentiating the force signals between the hinge and the temple. A pattern recognition was applied to extract statistical features and classify featured behavioral patterns, such as natural head movement, chewing, talking, and wink. The overall results showed that the average F1 score of the classification was about 94.0% and the accuracy above 89%. We believe this approach will be helpful for designing a non-intrusive and un-obtrusive eyewear-based ingestive behavior monitoring system.","authors":"Jungman Chung; Jungmin Chung; Wonjun Oh; Yongkyu Yoo; Won Gu Lee; Hyunwoo Bang","keywords":"Engineering; Health care","organization_affiliated":"School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea; Envisible, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"A glasses-type wearable device for monitoring the patterns of food intake and facial activity","id":"387cb8ea-1440-489b-a725-69bdb49bfc84"}
{"abstract":"Paravalvular leak (PVL) is a complication that occurs in 5–17% of patients after surgical prosthetic valve implantation. Whereas PVLs can be benign, some PVLs are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous closure using occluders specifically designed to improve closure and reduce procedural complications has now become the first-line treatment for PVL. In this Review, we first detail the frequency and clinical consequences of PVL closure. The role of cardiac imaging in the assessment and management of PVL, including echocardiographic imaging and adjunctive techniques such as CT, is then discussed, together with important considerations for the percutaneous closure of PVL, such as access site and device selection. Finally, we summarize the clinical evidence for percutaneous closure of PVL, including large national registries from Ireland, Spain and the UK, as well as head-to-head data comparing this procedure with surgical closure. Paravalvular leak (PVL) is a common complication after surgical prosthetic valve implantation. This Review details the role of cardiac imaging in the assessment and management of PVL, summarizes the clinical evidence for percutaneous closure of PVL and compares this procedure with surgical closure.

{"abstract":"Obesity, often represented by higher body mass index (BMI), is not yet fully understood as a potential risk factor for poor clinical outcomes of prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy (RP). This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMI and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival in RP patients. This study retrospectively reviewed a total of 2.997 PCa patients who underwent RP between 2006 and 2017. The patients were stratified into three BMI groups according to the WHO recommendations for Asian men: normal weight (\u003c23 kg/m2), overweight (≥23 to \u003c27.5 kg/m2) and obese (≥27.5 kg/m2). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken to evaluate the factors influencing the BCR rates including BMI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to test the association of obesity with BCR-free survival. The final pathologic results showed obese patients had greater positive surgical margin rates (13.9%, p \u003c 0.001), extraprostatic invasion (19.9%, p \u003c 0.001), advanced pathological Gleason score (GS) ≥ 8 (50.8%, p = 0.017), and lymph node invasion (LNI) (14.5%, p = 0.021) than overweight and normal weight patients. According to Kaplan-Meier analyses, obese patients, especially with BMI ≥ 27.5, were more likely to have lower BCR-free-survival. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus, LNI status, pT, pathologic GS, extraprostatic invasion, margin positivity and obesity with BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 were significantly associated with BCR-free survival after RP. Obesity (higher BMI) was significantly associated with BCR after RP. BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 was an independent predictor of BCR-free survival.","authors":"Young Dong Yu; Seok-Soo Byun; Sang Eun Lee; Sung Kyu Hong","keywords":"Prostate cancer; Surgical oncology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea; Department of Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea; Department of Urology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea; Department of Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea; Department of Urology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea","title":"Impact of Body Mass Index on Oncological Outcomes of Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy","id":"ffd06e63-8aa4-4bbb-9ab4-f55d26c4f195"}
{"abstract":"The use of social media is increasing globally and is employed in a variety of ways in the prostate cancer community. In addition to their use in research, advocacy, and awareness campaigns, social media offer vast opportunities for education and networking for patients with prostate cancer and health-care professionals, and many educational resources and support networks are available to patients with prostate cancer and their caregivers. Despite the considerable potential for social media to be employed in the field of prostate cancer, concerns remain — particularly regarding the maintenance of patient confidentiality, variable information quality, and possible financial conflicts of interest. A number of professional societies have, therefore, issued guidance regarding social media use in medicine. Social media are used extensively in other cancer communities, particularly among patients with breast cancer, and both the quantity and type of information available are expected to grow in the future. Social media offer varied opportunities for education and networking for patients with prostate cancer and health-care professionals, as well as potential uses in research, advocacy, and awareness campaigns. In this Review, leaders in the field discuss social media in prostate cancer and consider the obstacles and potential for their use in the future.","authors":"Stacy Loeb; Matthew S.

{"abstract":"To explore a simple and easy-to-learn procedure for the isolation of human quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that requires no advanced training. Thus reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This protocol will provide sufficient primary cells with minimal contaminants for future basic research on diseases associated with human HSCs. Normal liver tissues were isolated from patients undergoing hepatic hemangioma resection, and a single cell suspension of these tissues was prepared using the Gentle MACS tissue processor. By using this method, the difficulty of the procedure was reduced, fewer cells were lost during the preparation treatments, and the maximal activity of single cells was maintained. Following preparation of the cell suspension, the HSCs were further isolated using a Nycodenz density gradient. Cell viability was examined by trypan blue staining, and the purity of the quiescent human HSCs was determined by autofluorescence and oil red O staining. Activated and quiescent human HSCs were identified using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The cell cycle distribution in activated and quiescent human HSCs was analyzed by flow cytometry.The recovery rate of the HSCs was approximately (2.1 ± 0.23) × 106 of tissue, with 94.43 ± 1.89% cell viability and 93.8 ± 1.52% purity. The technique used in this study is a simple, high-yield, and repeatable method for HSC isolation that is worthy of recommendation.","authors":"Xiangyu Zhai; Wei Wang; Dandan Dou; Yunlong Ma; Du Gang; Zhengchen Jiang; Binyao Shi; Bin Jin","keywords":"Hepatic stellate cells; Liver diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; School of medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China; School of basic medical sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China; Department of general surgery, Qilu hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China","title":"A novel technique to prepare a single cell suspension of isolated quiescent human hepatic stellate cells","id":"de7cacec-bf11-4c4b-91fe-944a893d112a"}

The latest contract change of 2006 resulted in much disquiet, and services continue to be piloted in order to develop a contract that satisfies the needs of both government and the profession. Within this context, this paper explores the issues surrounding the present situation. To date, the profession has expanded service provision into the private market which has resulted in an exaggerated inverse care provision. This could be perceived as a move towards a retail philosophy and away from healthcare.

{"abstract":"Determining the impacts of invasive pathogens on tree mortality and growth is a difficult task, in particular in the case of species occurring naturally at low frequencies in mixed stands. In this study, we quantify such effects by comparing national forest inventory data collected before and after pathogen invasion. In Norway, Fraxinus excelsior is a minor species representing less than 1% of the trees in the forests and being attacked by the invasive pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus since 2006. By studying deviations between inventories, we estimated a 74% higher-than-expected average ash mortality and a 13% slower-than-expected growth of the surviving ash trees, indicating a lack of compensation by the remaining ash. We could confidently assign mortality and growth losses to ash dieback as no mortality or growth shifts were observed for co-occurring tree species in the same plots. The mortality comparisons also show regional patterns with higher mortality in areas with the longest disease history in Norway. Considering that ash is currently mostly growing in mixed forests and that no signs of compensation were observed by the surviving ash trees, a significant habitat loss and niche replacement could be anticipated in the mid-term.","authors":"Olalla Díaz-Yáñez; Blas Mola-Yudego; Volkmar Timmermann; Mari Mette Tollefsrud; Ari M.

{"abstract":"High temperature (temperature over 35 °C) is an extremely important environmental factor that affects the maize grain quality in Southern China. The effects of heat stress after pollination on grain protein and starch deposition and activities of involved enzymes were studied in a pot trail in 2014 and 2015. Results showed that grain dry weight reductions at maturity were 19.8% and 19.1%, whereas starch contents (mg g−1) were reduced by 3.0% and 3.3%, and starch accumulation (mg grain−1) were reduced 22.2% and 21.8% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Protein content was decreased by heat stress before 15 DAP and increased thereafter. At maturity, protein contents (mg g−1) were increased by 24.5% and 25.3% in 2014 and 2015, while protein accumulation (mg grain−1) were not affected by heat stress. In response to heat stress, glutamate synthase activity was enhanced by 29.1–82.9% in 2014 and 2.0–141.8% in 2015, whereas glutamine synthetase activity was reduced by 1.9–43.5% in 2014 and 0.1–27.4% in 2015 throughout the grain filling. The activities of sucrose phosphate synthase were decreased by heat stress at 10–25DAP (12.7–32.0%) in 2014 and 15–20 DAP (23.2–27.5%) in 2015, and activities of sucrose synthase were decreased by heat stress at 5–15 DAP (20.0–45.0%) in 2014 and 15 DAP (22.0%) in 2015, repectively. The activities of enyzmes that involved in starch synthessis were all suppressed by heat stress during grain filling, and the reduction of adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase, soluble starch synthase, and starch branching enzyme were decreased by 21.3–43.1%, 19.1–29.2%, and 7.0–45.6% in 2014 and 1.8–78.5%, 21.4–51.2%, and 11.0–48.0% in 2015, respectively. Conclusively, grain weight and starch deposition were suppressed by heat stress due to the decreased activities of enzymes involved in starch synthesis, and the increased protein content was due to the enhanced activity of glutamate synthase.","authors":"Huan Yang; Xiaotian Gu; Mengqiu Ding; Weiping Lu; Dalei Lu","keywords":"Heat; Plant embryogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, P.

{"abstract":"Dietary lipids favor the growth of the pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia, but the relevance of this expansion in metabolic syndrome pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we showed that B. wadsworthia synergizes with high fat diet (HFD) to promote higher inflammation, intestinal barrier dysfunction and bile acid dysmetabolism, leading to higher glucose dysmetabolism and hepatic steatosis. Host-microbiota transcriptomics analysis reveal pathways, particularly butanoate metabolism, which may underlie the metabolic effects mediated by B. wadsworthia. Pharmacological suppression of B. wadsworthia-associated inflammation demonstrate the bacterium’s intrinsic capacity to induce a negative impact on glycemic control and hepatic function. Administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 limits B. wadsworthia-induced immune and metabolic impairment by limiting its expansion, reducing inflammation and reinforcing intestinal barrier. Our results suggest a new avenue for interventions against western diet-driven inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Lipid intake is known to promote Bilophila wadsworthia growth. Here the authors show that B. wadsworthia aggravates high fat diet induced metabolic dysfunctions and its suppression, both pharmacologically or mediated by Lactobacillus rhamnosus, limits the severity of metabolic impairment.","authors":"Jane M.

{"abstract":"Microbes in ecosystems often develop coordinated metabolic interactions. Therefore, understanding metabolic interdependencies between microbes is critical to deciphering ecosystem function. In this study, we sought to deconstruct metabolic interdependencies in organohalide-respiring consortium ACT-3 containing Dehalobacter restrictus using a combination of metabolic modeling and experimental validation. D. restrictus possesses a complete set of genes for amino acid biosynthesis yet when grown in isolation requires amino acid supplementation. We reconciled this discrepancy using flux balance analysis considering cofactor availability, enzyme promiscuity, and shared protein expression patterns for several D. restrictus strains. Experimentally, 13C incorporation assays, growth assays, and metabolite analysis of D. restrictus strain PER-K23 cultures were performed to validate the model predictions. The model resolved that the amino acid dependency of D. restrictus resulted from restricted NADPH regeneration and predicted that malate supplementation would replenish intracellular NADPH. Interestingly, we observed unexpected export of pyruvate and glutamate in parallel to malate consumption in strain PER-K23 cultures. Further experimental analysis using the ACT-3 transfer cultures suggested the occurrence of an interspecies malate–pyruvate shuttle reconciling a redox imbalance, reminiscent of the mitochondrial malate shunt pathway in eukaryotic cells. Altogether, this study suggests that redox imbalance and metabolic complementarity are important driving forces for metabolite exchange in anaerobic microbial communities.","authors":"Po-Hsiang Wang; Kevin Correia; Han-Chen Ho; Naveen Venayak; Kayla Nemr; Robert Flick; Radhakrishnan Mahadevan; Elizabeth A.

{"abstract":"Although Heat Waves (HWs) are expected to increase due to global warming, they are a regional phenomenon that demands for local analyses. In this paper, we assess four HW metrics (HW duration, HW frequency, HW amplitude, and number of HWs per season) as well as the share of extremely warm days (TX95, according to the 95th percentile) in South America (SA). Our analysis included observations as well as simulations from global and regional models. In particular, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), and Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to project both TX95 estimates and HW metrics according to two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We found that in recent decades the share of extremely warm days has at least doubled over the period December–January–February (DJF) in northern SA; less significant increases have been observed in southern SA. We also found that by midcentury, under the RCP4.5 scenario, extremely warm DJF days (as well as the number of HWs per season) are expected to increase by 5–10 times at locations close to the Equator and in the Atacama Desert. Increases are expected to be less pronounced in southern SA. Projections under the RCP8.5 scenario are more striking, particularly in tropical areas where half or more of the days could be extremely warm by midcentury.","authors":"S. Feron; R. R. Cordero; A.

{"abstract":"Small molecules and antibodies each have advantages and limitations as therapeutics. Here, we present for the first time to our knowledge, the structure-guided design of “chemibodies” as small molecule-antibody hybrids that offer dual recognition of a single target by both a small molecule and an antibody, using DPP-IV enzyme as a proof of concept study. Biochemical characterization demonstrates that the chemibodies present superior DPP-IV inhibition compared to either small molecule or antibody component alone. We validated our design by successfully solving a co-crystal structure of a chemibody in complex with DPP-IV, confirming specific binding of the small molecule portion at the interior catalytic site and the Fab portion at the protein surface. The discovery of chemibodies presents considerable potential for novel therapeutics that harness the power of both small molecule and antibody modalities to achieve superior specificity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties.","authors":"Alan C.

{"abstract":"There is a great interest in developing biomarkers to enhance early detection and clinical management of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). However, the developmental path towards a clinically valid biomarker remains extremely challenging. Ideally, the initial key step in moving a newly discovered biomarker towards clinical implementation is independent replication. Therefore, the focus of this review is on biomarkers that consistently showed clinical relevance in two or more publications. We searched PubMed database for relevant papers across different TSCC sample sources, i.e., body fluids (saliva, serum/plasma) and tissues. No restriction regarding the date of publication was applied except for immunohistochemistry (IHC); only studies published between 2010 and June 2017 were included. The search strategy identified 1429 abstracts, of which 96 papers, examining 150 biomarkers, were eventually included. Of these papers, 66% were exploratory studies evaluating single or a panel of biomarkers in one publication. Ultimately, based on studies that had undergone validation for their clinical relevance in at least two independent studies, we identified 10 promising candidates, consisting of different types of molecules (IL-6, IL-8, and Prolactin in liquid samples; HIF-1α, SOX2, E-cadherin, vimentin, MALAT1, TP53, and NOTCH1 in tissue biopsies) Although more exploratory research is needed with newer methods to identify biomarkers for TSCC, rigorous validation of biomarkers that have already shown unbiased assessment in at least two publications should be considered a high priority. Further research on these promising biomarkers or their combination in multi-institutional studies, could provide new possibilities to develop a specific panel for early diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized treatments.","authors":"Aisha A.

{"abstract":"Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla and colleagues use a targeted epigenomic approach to investigate the role of LINE-1 retroelements during early mouse development. Their data suggest that timely activation of LINE-1 regulates global chromatin accessibility and is integral to the mouse developmental program. After fertilization, to initiate development, gametes are reprogramed to become totipotent. Approximately half of the mammalian genome consists of repetitive elements, including retrotransposons, some of which are transcribed after fertilization. Retrotransposon activation is generally assumed to be a side effect of the extensive chromatin remodeling underlying the epigenetic reprogramming of gametes. Here, we used a targeted epigenomic approach to address whether specific retrotransposon families play a direct role in chromatin organization and developmental progression. We demonstrate that premature silencing of LINE-1 elements decreases chromatin accessibility, whereas prolonged activation prevents the gradual chromatin compaction that occurs naturally in developmental progression. Preventing LINE-1 activation and interfering with its silencing decreases developmental rates independently of the coding nature of the LINE-1 transcript, thus suggesting that LINE-1 functions primarily at the chromatin level. Our data suggest that activation of LINE-1 regulates global chromatin accessibility at the beginning of development and indicate that retrotransposon activation is integral to the developmental program.","authors":"Joanna W Jachowicz; Xinyang Bing; Julien Pontabry; Ana Bošković; Oliver J Rando; Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla","keywords":"Developmental biology; Functional genomics; Genomics","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum München, München, Germany; INSERM U964, U de S, CU de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA; Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum München, München, Germany; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA; Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum München, München, Germany; INSERM U964, U de S, CU de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France","title":"LINE-1 activation after fertilization regulates global chromatin accessibility in the early mouse embryo","id":"a54e022d-6164-4153-8b3f-01cfbd237b28"}
{"abstract":"Particle accelerators have made an enormous impact in all fields of natural sciences, from elementary particle physics, to the imaging of proteins and the development of new pharmaceuticals. Modern light sources have advanced many fields by providing extraordinarily bright, short X-ray pulses. Here we present a novel numerical study, demonstrating that existing third generation light sources can significantly enhance the brightness and photon energy of their X-ray pulses by undulating their beams within plasma wakefields. This study shows that a three order of magnitude increase in X-ray brightness and over an order of magnitude increase in X-ray photon energy is achieved by passing a 3 GeV electron beam through a two-stage plasma insertion device. The production mechanism micro-bunches the electron beam and ensures the pulses are radially polarised on creation. We also demonstrate that the micro-bunched electron beam is itself an effective wakefield driver that can potentially accelerate a witness electron beam up to 6 GeV.","authors":"J. A. Holloway; P. A.

{"abstract":"Perennial rivers and streams make a disproportionate contribution to global carbon (C) cycling. However, the contribution of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), which sometimes cease to flow and can dry completely, is largely ignored although they represent over half the global river network. Substantial amounts of terrestrial plant litter (TPL) accumulate in dry riverbeds and, upon rewetting, this material can undergo rapid microbial processing. We present the results of a global research collaboration that collected and analysed TPL from 212 dry riverbeds across major environmental gradients and climate zones. We assessed litter decomposability by quantifying the litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and oxygen (O2) consumption in standardized assays and estimated the potential short-term CO2 emissions during rewetting events. Aridity, cover of riparian vegetation, channel width and dry-phase duration explained most variability in the quantity and decomposability of plant litter in IRES. Our estimates indicate that a single pulse of CO2 emission upon litter rewetting contributes up to 10% of the daily CO2 emission from perennial rivers and stream, particularly in temperate climates. This indicates that the contributions of IRES should be included in global C-cycling assessments. Rewetting of plant litter accumulated in dry riverbeds releases pulses of CO2, reveals a global analysis of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams.","authors":"T. Datry; A. Foulquier; R.

The immune system needs to be finely balanced, as an overactive immune system can result in autoimmunity, allergy and inflammatory disorders, whereas over-attenuation can result in infections and cancer. Here, we describe how the immune system can be modulated using chemical approaches, with a focus on the chemical modification and application of antibodies, one of the major components of the immune defence system. Progress includes the development of antibody–drug conjugates and imaging reagents based on antibody fragments and nanobodies, and their clinical and preclinical applications for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease are discussed. Humans have evolved innate and adaptive immune systems to survive infection. Chemical approaches have enabled modulation of the immune system to activate or dampen it, leading to the development of new treatments for cancer and autoimmunity.

{"abstract":"Intestinal microbiotas contain beneficial microorganisms that protect against pathogen colonization; treatment with antibiotics disrupts the microbiota and compromises colonization resistance. Here, we determine the impact of exchanging microorganisms between hosts on resilience to the colonization of invaders after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. We assess the functional consequences of dysbiosis using a mouse model of colonization resistance against Escherichia coli. Antibiotics caused stochastic loss of members of the microbiota, but the microbiotas of co-housed mice remained more similar to each other compared with the microbiotas among singly housed animals. Strikingly, co-housed mice maintained colonization resistance after treatment with antibiotics, whereas most singly housed mice were susceptible to E. coli. The ability to retain or share the commensal Klebsiella michiganensis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, was sufficient for colonization resistance after treatment with antibiotics. K. michiganensis generally outcompeted E. coli in vitro, but in vivo administration of galactitol—a nutrient that supports the growth of only E. coli—to bi-colonized gnotobiotic mice abolished the colonization-resistance capacity of K. michiganensis against E. coli, supporting the idea that nutrient competition is the primary interaction mechanism. K. michiganensis also hampered colonization of the pathogen Salmonella, prolonging host survival. Our results address functional consequences of the stochastic effects of microbiota perturbations, whereby microbial transmission through host interactions can facilitate reacquisition of beneficial commensals, minimizing the negative impact of antibiotics. Co-housing mice is shown to induce resistance against enterobacterial infection after antibiotic treatment through the ability to retain or share Klebsiella michiganensis, which is necessary and sufficient to prevent infection through competition for nutrients.","authors":"Rita A.

{"abstract":"Predicting the responses of streamflow to changes in forest management is fundamental to the sustainable regulation of water resources. However, studies of changes in forest cover have yielded unclear and largely unpredictable results. Here we compile a comprehensive and spatially distributed database of forest-management studies worldwide, to assess the factors that control streamflow response to forest planting and removal. We introduce a vegetation-to-bedrock model that includes seven key landscape factors in order to explain the impacts of forest removal and planting on water yield. We show that the amount of water stored in a landscape is the most important factor in predicting streamflow response to forest removal, whereas the loss of water through evaporation and transpiration is the most important factor in predicting streamflow response to forest planting. Our findings affect model parameterizations in climate change mitigation schemes (involving, for example, afforestation or deforestation) in different geologic and climate regions around the world, and inform practices for the sustainable management of water resources. Analysis of forest-management studies finds that forest removal is more likely to increase streamflow in areas with greater water storage between the surface and bedrock, and that forest planting is more likely to decrease streamflow in drier climates.","authors":"Jaivime Evaristo; Jeffrey J.

{"abstract":"Universal quantum computation requires high-fidelity single-qubit rotations and controlled two-qubit gates. Along with high-fidelity single-qubit gates, strong efforts have been made in developing robust two-qubit logic gates in electrically gated quantum dot systems to realise a compact and nanofabrication-compatible architecture. Here we perform measurements of state-conditional coherent oscillations of a charge qubit. Using a quadruple quantum dot formed in a Si/SiGe heterostructure, we show the first demonstration of coherent two-axis control of a double quantum dot charge qubit in undoped Si/SiGe, performing Larmor and Ramsey oscillation measurements. We extract the strength of the capacitive coupling between a pair of double quantum dots by measuring the detuning energy shift (≈75 μeV) of one double dot depending on the excess charge configuration of the other double dot. We further demonstrate that the strong capacitive coupling allows fast, state-conditional Landau–Zener–Stückelberg oscillations with a conditional π phase flip time of about 80 ps, showing a promising pathway towards multi-qubit entanglement and control in semiconductor quantum dots. Researchers in the United States and Korea demonstrate control of individual electrons in an electronic device governed by quantum mechanics. Mark Eriksson from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and co-workers developed a building block for a quantum computer that traps single electrons between nanoscale-spaced electrical contacts on silicon–germanium. Instead of using electrical signals to create the ones and zeros used in traditional information processing, quantum computers use physical objects called quantum bits, or qubits. The qubit used by Eriksson's team is known as a quantum dot charge qubit. The team created two pairs of quantum dots and used the position of an electron in one pair to influence quantum oscillations of the electron in the other pair. Coupling double quantum dots in this way could form the basis of a compact quantum-computing architecture that is compatible with the fabrication techniques used in modern electronics.","authors":"Daniel R Ward; Dohun Kim; Donald E Savage; Max G Lagally; Ryan H Foote; Mark Friesen; Susan N Coppersmith; Mark A Eriksson","keywords":"Electronic and spintronic devices; Quantum dots; Quantum information; Qubits","organization_affiliated":"Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, USA; Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA; Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA","title":"State-conditional coherent charge qubit oscillations in a Si/SiGe quadruple quantum dot","id":"9dbe4061-aacb-4a8e-8f27-d5a75d5e6c58"}

{"abstract":"Shape variability represents an important direct response of organisms to selective environments. Here, we use a combination of geometric morphometrics and generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to identify spatial patterns of natural shell shape variation in the North Atlantic and Arctic blue mussels, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, with environmental gradients of temperature, salinity and food availability across 3980 km of coastlines. New statistical methods and multiple study systems at various geographical scales allowed the uncoupling of the developmental and genetic contributions to shell shape and made it possible to identify general relationships between blue mussel shape variation and environment that are independent of age and species influences. We find salinity had the strongest effect on the latitudinal patterns of Mytilus shape, producing shells that were more elongated, narrower and with more parallel dorsoventral margins at lower salinities. Temperature and food supply, however, were the main drivers of mussel shape heterogeneity. Our findings revealed similar shell shape responses in Mytilus to less favourable environmental conditions across the different geographical scales analysed. Our results show how shell shape plasticity represents a powerful indicator to understand the alterations of blue mussel communities in rapidly changing environments.","authors":"Luca Telesca; Kati Michalek; Trystan Sanders; Lloyd S.

{"abstract":"Surrounded by speakers of Indo-European, Dravidian and Tibeto-Burman languages, around 11 million Munda (a branch of Austroasiatic language family) speakers live in the densely populated and genetically diverse South Asia. Their genetic makeup holds components characteristic of South Asians as well as Southeast Asians. The admixture time between these components has been previously estimated on the basis of archaeology, linguistics and uniparental markers. Using genome-wide genotype data of 102 Munda speakers and contextual data from South and Southeast Asia, we retrieved admixture dates between 2000–3800 years ago for different populations of Munda. The best modern proxies for the source populations for the admixture with proportions 0.29/0.71 are Lao people from Laos and Dravidian speakers from Kerala in India. The South Asian population(s), with whom the incoming Southeast Asians intermixed, had a smaller proportion of West Eurasian genetic component than contemporary proxies. Somewhat surprisingly Malaysian Peninsular tribes rather than the geographically closer Austroasiatic languages speakers like Vietnamese and Cambodians show highest sharing of IBD segments with the Munda. In addition, we affirmed that the grouping of the Munda speakers into North and South Munda based on linguistics is in concordance with genome-wide data.","authors":"Kai Tätte; Luca Pagani; Ajai K.

{"abstract":"M2-polarized macrophages have been shown to adapt their 3D migration mode to physical properties of surrounding extracellular matrix. They migrate in the integrin-mediated adhesion and proteolytic activity-dependent “mesenchymal” mode in stiff matrices and in the integrin and protease-independent “amoeboid” mode in low density, porous environments. To find out what impact the switching between the migration modes has on expression of both protein-coding and non-coding genes we employed RNA sequencing of total RNA depleted of ribosomal RNA isolated from macrophages migrating in either mode in 3D collagens. Differentially expressed genes from both categories have been detected and the changes in expression of selected genes were further validated with RT-qPCR. The acquired data will facilitate better understanding of how mechanical properties of tissue microenvironment reflect in macrophage immune function and how the transitions between mesenchymal and amoeboid migratory modes are regulated at the gene expression level.

{"abstract":"Signaling by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, such as TGF-β3 and BMP7, and oxygen tension play a pivotal role in chondrocyte biology. The objective of this research was to investigate the endogenous BMP7 expression in human osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage and the effect of oxygen tension on the single or combined treatment with TGF-β3 and BMP7 on OA chondrocyte redifferentiation in three dimensional (3D) pellet cultures. The results showed the expression of BMP7 and its intracellular signaling target SMAD1/5/8 was decreased in early OA, while it was increased in later stages of OA. The combined treatment with TGF-β3 and BMP7, both in normoxia and hypoxia, was more effective than TGF-β3 or BMP7 alone in redifferentiating chondrocytes. This was reflected by Alcian blue/Safranin O staining and collagen type II protein expression, as well as by gene expression. Hypoxia elevated TGF-β3 and BMP7-induced matrix formation of OA chondrocytes and alleviated the catabolic gene expression. Interestingly, cells cultured under normoxia displayed mild signs of an inflammatory stress response, which was effectively counteracted by culturing the cells under low oxygen tension. Our data underscores the important modulatory role of oxygen tension on the chondrocyte’s responsiveness to TGF-β3 and/or BMP7.","authors":"Xiaobin Huang; Leilei Zhong; Janine N.

{"abstract":"Small molecule probes are indispensable tools to explore diverse cellular events. However, finding a specific probe of a target remains a high challenge. Here we report the discovery of Fast-TRFS, a specific and superfast fluorogenic probe of mammalian thioredoxin reductase, a ubiquitous enzyme involved in regulation of diverse cellular redox signaling pathways. By systematically examining the processes of fluorophore release and reduction of cyclic disulfides/diselenides by the enzyme, structural factors that determine the response rate and specificity of the probe are disclosed. Mechanistic studies reveal that the fluorescence signal is switched on by a simple reduction of the disulfide bond within the probe, which is in stark contrast to the sensing mechanism of published probes. The favorable properties of Fast-TRFS enable development of a high-throughput screening assay to discover inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase by using crude tissue extracts as a source of the enzyme. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) plays a crucial part in regulating cellular redox homeostasis. Here, the authors developed a fluorescent probe composed of a five-membered disulphide, a coumarin fluorophore and a urea linker that detects TrxR activity with fast response and high selectivity.","authors":"Xinming Li; Baoxin Zhang; Chaoxian Yan; Jin Li; Song Wang; Xiangxu Wei; Xiaoyan Jiang; Panpan Zhou; Jianguo Fang","keywords":"Enzymes; Fluorescent dyes; Thioredoxins","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry \u0026 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China","title":"A fast and specific fluorescent probe for thioredoxin reductase that works via disulphide bond cleavage","id":"f66e1e70-9714-4068-9799-f943733cb9fb"}
{"abstract":"Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have potential as both diagnostic and therapeutic vehicles. However, selective targeting and uptake in cancer cells remains challenging. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) can be combined with AuNP to achieve synergistic anti-cancer cytotoxicity. To explore synergistic mechanisms, we demonstrate both rate of AuNP uptake and total amount accumulated in U373MG Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells are significantly increased when exposed to 75 kV CAP generated by dielectric barrier discharge. No significant changes in the physical parameters of AuNP were caused by CAP but active transport mechanisms were stimulated in cells. Unlike many other biological effects of CAP, long-lived reactive species were not involved, and plasma-activated liquids did not replicate the effect. Chemical effects induced by direct and indirect exposure to CAP appears the dominant mediator of enhanced uptake. Transient physical alterations of membrane integrity played a minor role. 3D-reconstruction of deconvoluted confocal images confirmed AuNP accumulation in lysosomes and other acidic vesicles, which will be useful for future drug delivery and diagnostic strategies. Toxicity of AuNP significantly increased by 25-fold when combined with CAP. Our data indicate that direct exposure to CAP activates AuNP-dependent cytotoxicity by increasing AuNP endocytosis and trafficking to lysosomes in U373MG cells.","authors":"Zhonglei He; Kangze Liu; Eline Manaloto; Alan Casey; George P.

{"abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a commonly encountered syndrome associated with various aetiologies and pathophysiological processes leading to decreased kidney function. In addition to retention of waste products, impaired electrolyte homeostasis and altered drug concentrations, AKI induces a generalized inflammatory response that affects distant organs. Full recovery of kidney function is uncommon, which leaves these patients at risk of long-term morbidity and death. Estimates of AKI prevalence range from \u003c1% to 66%. These variations can be explained by not only population differences but also inconsistent use of standardized AKI classification criteria. The aetiology and incidence of AKI also differ between high-income and low-to-middle-income countries. High-income countries show a lower incidence of AKI than do low-to-middle-income countries, where contaminated water and endemic diseases such as malaria contribute to a high burden of AKI. Outcomes of AKI are similar to or more severe than those of patients in high-income countries. In all resource settings, suboptimal early recognition and care of patients with AKI impede their recovery and lead to high mortality, which highlights unmet needs for improved detection and diagnosis of AKI and for efforts to improve care for these patients. In this plenary Review, Hoste and colleagues describe the global epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI). The influence of modifiable and non-modifiable AKI risk factors, delayed diagnosis, variation in diagnostic criteria and disparities in access to health care are also discussed. ","authors":"Eric A.

{"abstract":"No therapies exist to prevent neuronal deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS), because the molecular mechanism responsible for the progressive neurodegeneration is unknown. We previously showed that axon injury-induced neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and optic nerve degeneration in traumatic and glaucomatous optic neuropathies. Optic neuritis, one of the most common clinical manifestations of MS, is readily modeled by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mouse. Using this in vivo model, we now show that ER stress is induced early in EAE and that modulation of ER stress by inhibition of eIF2α-CHOP and activation of XBP-1 in RGC specifically, protects RGC somata and axons and preserves visual function. This finding adds to the evidence that ER stress is a general upstream mechanism for neurodegeneration and suggests that targeting ER stress molecules is a promising therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection in MS.","authors":"Haoliang Huang; Linqing Miao; Feisi Liang; Xiaodong Liu; Lin Xu; Xiuyin Teng; Qizhao Wang; William H Ridder; Kenneth S Shindler; Yang Sun; Yang Hu","keywords":"Multiple sclerosis; Neurodegeneration; Neuroimmunology; Stress signalling","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, USA; Shriners Center for Neural Repair and Rehabilitation, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; Shriners Center for Neural Repair and Rehabilitation, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; Shriners Center for Neural Repair and Rehabilitation, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; Shriners Center for Neural Repair and Rehabilitation, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; Shriners Center for Neural Repair and Rehabilitation, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, USA; Southern California College of Optometry, Marshall B.

The body weight was not different between the CON and 18% CP diets, but 12% CP significantly decreased body weight after day 21. Compared to the CON, pigs fed with 12% CP decreased feed intake day 17 onwards. The 12% CP diet increased the energy expenditure during week 1 compared to the CON. The 12% CP influenced starch and sucrose, nitrogen, and branched-chain amino acids metabolism pathways. The feces of pigs fed with 12% CP were less enriched in Prevotella, but had higher relative abundance of Christensenedilaceae, Aligiphilus and Algoriphagus than CON and 18% CP. Overall, reducing dietary CP by 50%, but not by 25%, significantly influenced the physiological responses in nursery pigs.

{"abstract":"Autoantibodies have been implicated in schizophrenia aetiology. Here, novel autoantibodies were isolated from patients with schizophrenia. Autoantibody candidates were searched using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting with rat brain proteins as antigens and two sera pools (25 schizophrenia patients versus 25 controls) as antibodies. Immunoreactive antigens were identified by mass spectrometry. Antibody prevalence were evaluated by western blotting using human recombinant proteins. Furthermore, brain magnetic resonance imaging data (regional brain volumes and diffusion tensor imaging measures) were compared. Two proteins of the mitochondrial respiration pathway were identified as candidate antigens. Three patients with schizophrenia, but no controls, expressed antibodies targeting one of the candidate antigens, i.e., pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, somatic form, mitochondrial (PDHA1, EC 1.2.4.1), which is related to mitochondrial energy production. Anti-PDHA1 antibody-positive patients (n = 3) had increased volumes in the left occipital fusiform gyrus compared to both controls (n = 23, p = 0.017) and antibody-negative patients (n = 16, p = 0.009), as well as in the left cuneus compared to antibody-negative patients (n = 16, p = 0.018).

{"abstract":"How genetic information is modified to generate phenotypic variation within a species is one of the central questions in evolutionary biology. Here we focus on the striking intraspecific diversity of \u003e200 aposematic elytral (forewing) colour patterns of the multicoloured Asian ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis, which is regulated by a tightly linked genetic locus h. Our loss-of-function analyses, genetic association studies, de novo genome assemblies, and gene expression data reveal that the GATA transcription factor gene pannier is the major regulatory gene located at the h locus, and suggest that repeated inversions and cis-regulatory modifications at pannier led to the expansion of colour pattern variation in H. axyridis. Moreover, we show that the colour-patterning function of pannier is conserved in the seven-spotted ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata, suggesting that H. axyridis’ extraordinary intraspecific variation may have arisen from ancient modifications in conserved elytral colour-patterning mechanisms in ladybird beetles. The harlequin ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis, has remarkable phenotypic diversity, with over 200 colour patterns. Here, Ando et al. show that this patterning is regulated by the transcription factor gene pannier and has diversified by repeated inversions and cis-regulatory modifications of pannier.","authors":"Toshiya Ando; Takeshi Matsuda; Kumiko Goto; Kimiko Hara; Akinori Ito; Junya Hirata; Joichiro Yatomi; Rei Kajitani; Miki Okuno; Katsushi Yamaguchi; Masaaki Kobayashi; Tomoyuki Takano; Yohei Minakuchi; Masahide Seki; Yutaka Suzuki; Kentaro Yano; Takehiko Itoh; Shuji Shigenobu; Atsushi Toyoda; Teruyuki Niimi","keywords":"Evolutionary developmental biology; Evolutionary genetics; Structural variation","organization_affiliated":"Division of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan; Department of Basic Biology, School of Life Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Okazaki, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Japan; Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Japan; NIBB Core Research Facilities, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan; Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan; Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan; Comparative Genomics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan; Laboratory of Systems Genomics, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan; Laboratory of Systems Genomics, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan; Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan; Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Japan; Department of Basic Biology, School of Life Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Okazaki, Japan; NIBB Core Research Facilities, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan; Comparative Genomics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan; Advanced Genomics Center, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan; Division of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan; Department of Basic Biology, School of Life Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Okazaki, Japan; Laboratory of Sericulture and Entomoresources, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan","title":"Repeated inversions within a pannier intron drive diversification of intraspecific colour patterns of ladybird beetles","id":"8a3e3133-adf6-4652-9719-46f6d082bb8a"}
{"abstract":"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a debilitating condition characterized by the pathologic formation of ectopic bone. HO occurs commonly following orthopedic surgeries, burns, and neurologic injuries. While surgical excision may provide palliation, the procedure is often burdened with significant intra-operative blood loss due to a more robust contribution of blood supply to the pathologic bone than to native bone. Based on these clinical observations, we set out to examine the role of vascular signaling in HO. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) has previously been shown to be a crucial pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic cue during normal bone development and homeostasis. Our findings, using a validated mouse model of HO, demonstrate that HO lesions are highly vascular, and that VEGFA is critical to ectopic bone formation, despite lacking a contribution of endothelial cells within the developing anlagen.","authors":"Charles Hwang; Simone Marini; Amanda K.

{"abstract":"The practical application of nanoparticles (NPs) as chemotherapeutic drug delivery systems is often hampered by issues such as poor circulation stability and targeting inefficiency. Here, we have utilized a simple approach to prepare biocompatible and biodegradable pH-responsive hybrid NPs that overcome these issues. The NPs consist of a drug-loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) core covalently ‘wrapped’ with a crosslinked bovine serum albumin (BSA) shell designed to minimize interactions with serum proteins and macrophages that inhibit target recognition. The shell is functionalized with the acidity-triggered rational membrane (ATRAM) peptide to facilitate internalization specifically into cancer cells within the acidic tumor microenvironment. Following uptake, the unique intracellular conditions of cancer cells degrade the NPs, thereby releasing the chemotherapeutic cargo. The drug-loaded NPs showed potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo while exhibiting no toxicity to healthy tissue. Our results demonstrate that the ATRAM-BSA-PLGA NPs are a promising targeted cancer drug delivery platform. Palanikumar et al. prepare pH-responsive nanoparticles with drug-loaded PLGA core, cross-linked BSA corona to avoid opsonisation, and functionalised with ATRAM peptide that binds the cell membrane at low pH such as tumour microenvironment. The nanoparticles display both in vitro and in vivo efficacy while evading recognition by macrophages.","authors":"L. Palanikumar; Sumaya Al-Hosani; Mona Kalmouni; Vanessa P.

{"abstract":"Bone is the key innovation underpinning the evolution of the vertebrate skeleton, yet its origin is mired by debate over interpretation of the most primitive bone-like tissue, aspidin. This has variously been interpreted as cellular bone, acellular bone, dentine or an intermediate of dentine and bone. The crux of the controversy is the nature of unmineralized spaces pervading the aspidin matrix, which have alternatively been interpreted as having housed cells, cell processes or Sharpey’s fibres. Discriminating between these hypotheses has been hindered by the limits of traditional histological methods. Here, we use synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy to reveal the nature of aspidin. We show that the spaces exhibit a linear morphology incompatible with interpretations that they represent voids left by cells or cell processes. Instead, these spaces represent intrinsic collagen fibre bundles that form a scaffold about which mineral was deposited. Aspidin is thus acellular dermal bone. We reject hypotheses that it is a type of dentine, cellular bone or transitional tissue. Our study suggests that the full repertoire of skeletal tissue types was established before the divergence of the earliest known skeletonizing vertebrates, indicating that the corresponding cell types evolved rapidly following the divergence of cyclostomes and gnathostomes. The nature of aspidin, the most primitive bone-like tissue, is controversial. Here, the authors show that aspidin is acellular dermal bone, suggesting that early vertebrates possessed a full repertoire of skeletal tissue types.","authors":"Joseph N. Keating; Chloe L.

{"abstract":"To develop battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices with high energy and power densities, we propose a rational design of a quaternary hybrid superstructure by using a high-energy biotemplate. This new superstructure is composed of stable fullerene C60 nanocages, electroactive Na4FeO3, high-energy Li3V2(PO4)3 and soft carbon as well as tubular ordered mesoporous channels. This design takes advantage of the unique properties of each component, resulting in nanocomposites with synergistic effects to improve the charge transfer and energy storage. We found that this quaternary hybrid electrode has both high energy and power densities as well as a long cycling life in a Li/Na mixed-ion electrolyte, outperforming a multitude of other battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices reported thus far. The charge storage mechanisms of this hybrid superstructure are proposed for optimizing the electrode design. An energy-storage device that has the advantages of both batteries and supercapacitors has been developed by researchers in China and Sweden. Batteries can store a lot of energy in a small space: they have a high energy density. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, can be more quickly charged and discharged: they have a high power density. Wen He from the Qilu University of Technology in Jinan, Jiefang Zhu from Uppsala University and their colleagues have created a hybrid energy-storage device that has both high energy density and high power density. Their device uses a wide range of different materials combining carbon nanocages, soft carbon, and the electroactive material Na4FeO3. This design takes advantage of the unique properties of each component, resulting in improved charge transfer and energy storage. Achieving both high energy and high power densities in one hybrid energy-storage device is highly challenging, yet critically important for many applications. Here, the authors demonstrate that the inherent limitations of batteries and supercapacitors can be solved by developing a quaternary hybrid superstructure electrode using a high-energy biotemplate.

{"abstract":"The unusually high demand for metals in the brain, along with insufficient understanding of how their dysregulation contributes to neurological diseases, motivates the study of how inorganic chemistry influences neural circuitry. We now report that the transition metal copper is essential for regulating rest–activity cycles and arousal. Copper imaging and gene expression analysis in zebrafish identifies the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a vertebrate-specific neuromodulatory circuit critical for regulating sleep, arousal, attention, memory and emotion, as a copper-enriched unit with high levels of copper transporters CTR1 and ATP7A and the copper enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) that produces NE. Copper deficiency induced by genetic disruption of ATP7A, which loads copper into DBH, lowers NE levels and hinders LC function as manifested by disruption in rest–activity modulation. Moreover, LC dysfunction caused by copper deficiency from ATP7A disruption can be rescued by restoring synaptic levels of NE, establishing a molecular CTR1–ATP7A–DBH–NE axis for copper-dependent LC function. Copper contributes to regulating zebrafish rest–activity cycles through the locus coeruleus system by modulating the biosynthesis of norepinephrine; brain copper deficiency leads to lower levels of both synaptic norepinephrine and daytime activity.

{"abstract":"Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) affect a large population, and it cannot heal without doctors’ interventions. However, many patients do not get the medical advisory service in time. At the same time, the doctors also need an assistant tool to classify the patients according to the severity level of CVI. We propose an automatic classification method, named CVI-classifier to help doctors and patients. In this approach, first, low-level image features are mapped into middle-level semantic features by a concept classifier, and a multi-scale semantic model is constructed to form the image representation with rich semantics. Second, a scene classifier is trained using an optimized feature subset calculated by the high-order dependency based feature selection approach, and is used to estimate CVI’s severity. At last, classification accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1-score are used to evaluate classification performance. Experiments on the CVI images from 217 patients’ medical records demonstrated superior performance and efficiency for CVI-classifier, with classification accuracy up to 90.92%, kappa coefficient of 0.8735 and F1score of 0.9006. This method also outperformed doctors’ diagnosis (doctors rely solely on images to make judgments) with accuracy, kappa and F1-score improved by 9.11%, 0.1250 and 0.0955 respectively.","authors":"Qiang Shi; Weiya Chen; Ye Pan; Shan Yin; Yan Fu; Jiacai Mei; Zhidong Xue","keywords":"Diagnosis; Information technology","organization_affiliated":"School of Software Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Software Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Vascular surgery of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; School of Software Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Mechanical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Vascular surgery of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; School of Software Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","title":"An Automatic Classification Method on Chronic Venous Insufficiency Images","id":"b0b8bb55-1f3b-48a3-9a0f-cf40633425b8"}
{"abstract":"Human activities continue to erode the tree of life, requiring us to prioritize research and conservation. Amphibians represent key victims and bellwethers of global change, and the need for action to conserve them is drastically outpacing knowledge. We provide a phylogeny incorporating nearly all extant amphibians (7,238 species). Current amphibian diversity is composed of both older, depauperate lineages and extensive, more recent tropical radiations found in select clades. Frog and salamander diversification increased strongly after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary, preceded by a potential mass-extinction event in salamanders. Diversification rates of subterranean caecilians varied little over time. Biogeographically, the Afro- and Neotropics harbour a particularly high proportion of Gondwanan relicts, comprising species with high evolutionary distinctiveness (ED). These high-ED species represent a large portion of the branches in the present tree: around 28% of all phylogenetic diversity comes from species in the top 10% of ED. The association between ED and imperilment is weak, but many species with high ED are now imperilled or lack formal threat status, suggesting opportunities for integrating evolutionary position and phylogenetic heritage in addressing the current extinction crisis. By providing a phylogenetic estimate for extant amphibians and identifying their threats and ED, we offer a preliminary basis for a quantitatively informed global approach to conserving the amphibian tree of life. A phylogeny of nearly all extant amphibian species reveals biogeographic patterns of evolutionary distinctiveness and current threat exposure that will inform conservation strategies for these groups.","authors":"Walter Jetz; R.

{"abstract":"We report a case of pneumocephalus and pneumorachis i.e., air in the cranial cavity and the spinal canal, which are rarely associated with a primary spinal cause. Their concomitant occurrence and association with a late presenting dural leak are also uncommon. A 70-year-old man presented 1 month after decompressive surgery for lumbar canal stenosis with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the wound site and severe headache. There were no signs of surgical site infection or meningitis. There was no intraoperative or immediate postoperative evidence of dural tear. He was neurologically intact. On detailed work-up, he was found to have air collections in the subarachnoid and intraventricular spaces in the brain and intraspinal air in both the cervical and the lumbar regions. He showed gradual resolution of these findings radiologically and symptomatic improvement through conservative management with analgesics, empirical antibiotics, high flow oxygen, and maintenance of hydration within 1 month. Pneumocephalus and pneumorachis are commonly seen after trauma. Spine surgery is a rare cause. They may present with symptoms similar to meningitis and may be erroneously diagnosed and treated. No standard treatment guidelines exist in the literature. Most cases have been managed conservatively. Early detection may allow noninvasive management leading to complete resolution.","authors":"Mayank Gupta; Kalidindi Kalyan Kumar Varma; Harvinder Singh Chhabra","keywords":"Encephalopathy; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Department of Spine Surgery, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Delhi, India; Department of Spine Surgery, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Delhi, India; Department of Spine Surgery, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Delhi, India","title":"A rare case of concomitant pneumocephalus and pneumorachis after lumbar spine surgery with late presenting dural leak","id":"242fcf35-8502-4047-9ba2-2fcea0681a24"}
{"abstract":"It has been recently proposed that space, time, and number might share a common representation in the brain. Evidence supporting this idea comes from adaptation studies demonstrating that prolonged exposure to a given stimulus feature distorts the perception of different characteristics. For example, visual motion adaptation affects both perceived position and duration of subsequent stimuli presented in the adapted location. Here, we tested whether motion adaptation also affects perceived numerosity, by testing the effect of adaptation to translating or rotating stimuli moving either at high (20 Hz) or low (5 Hz) speed. Adaptation to fast translational motion yielded a robust reduction in the apparent numerosity of the adapted stimulus (~25%) while adaptation to slow translational or circular motion (either 20 Hz or 5 Hz) yielded a weaker but still significant compression. Control experiments suggested that none of these results could be accounted for in terms of stimulus masking. Taken together, our results are consistent with the extant literature supporting the idea of a generalized magnitude system underlying the representation of numerosity, space and time via common metrics. However, as changes in perceived numerosity co-varied with both adapting motion profile and speed, our evidence also suggests complex and asymmetric interactions between different magnitude representations.","authors":"Michele Fornaciai; Irene Togoli; Roberto Arrighi","keywords":"Human behaviour; Visual system","organization_affiliated":"Department of Psychological \u0026 Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA; Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Pharmacology and Child health (NEUROFARBA), University of Florence, Firenze, Italy; Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Pharmacology and Child health (NEUROFARBA), University of Florence, Firenze, Italy","title":"Motion-induced compression of perceived numerosity","id":"c0681791-04c8-461f-88ff-f76d2b39f918"}
{"abstract":"To delineate the genotype–phenotype correlation in individuals with likely pathogenic variants in the CLTC gene. We describe 13 individuals with de novo CLTC variants. Causality of variants was determined by using the tolerance landscape of CLTC and computer-assisted molecular modeling where applicable. Phenotypic abnormalities observed in the individuals identified with missense and in-frame variants were compared with those with nonsense or frameshift variants in CLTC. All de novo variants were judged to be causal. Combining our data with that of 14 previously reported affected individuals (n = 27), all had intellectual disability (ID), ranging from mild to moderate/severe, with or without additional neurologic, behavioral, craniofacial, ophthalmologic, and gastrointestinal features. Microcephaly, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and epilepsy were more frequently observed in individuals with missense and in-frame variants than in those with nonsense and frameshift variants. However, this difference was not significant. The wide phenotypic variability associated with likely pathogenic CLTC variants seems to be associated with allelic heterogeneity. The detailed clinical characterization of a larger cohort of individuals with pathogenic CLTC variants is warranted to support the hypothesis that missense and in-frame variants exert a dominant-negative effect, whereas the nonsense and frameshift variants would result in haploinsufficiency.","authors":"Maria J.

{"abstract":"Cell culture and protein target-based compound screening strategies, though broadly utilized in selecting candidate compounds, often fail to eliminate candidate compounds with non-target effects and/or safety concerns until late in the drug developmental process. Phenotype screening using intact research animals is attractive because it can help identify small molecule candidate compounds that have a high probability of proceeding to clinical use. Most FDA approved, first-in-class small molecules were identified from phenotypic screening. However, phenotypic screening using rodent models is labor intensive, low-throughput, and very expensive. As a novel alternative for small molecule screening, we have been developing gene expression disease profiles, termed the Transcriptional Disease Signature (TDS), as readout of small molecule screens for therapeutic molecules. In this concept, compounds that can reverse, or otherwise affect known disease-associated gene expression patterns in whole animals may be rapidly identified for more detailed downstream direct testing of their efficacy and mode of action. To establish proof of concept for this screening strategy, we employed a transgenic strain of a small aquarium fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes), that overexpresses the malignant melanoma driver gene xmrk, a mutant egfr gene, that is driven by a pigment cell-specific mitf promoter. In this model, melanoma develops with 100% penetrance. Using the transgenic medaka malignant melanoma model, we established a screening system that employs the NanoString nCounter platform to quantify gene expression within custom sets of TDS gene targets that we had previously shown to exhibit differential transcription among xmrk-transgenic and wild-type medaka. Compound-modulated gene expression was identified using an internet-accessible custom-built data processing pipeline. The effect of a given drug on the entire TDS profile was estimated by comparing compound-modulated genes in the TDS using an activation Z-score and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. TDS gene probes were designed that target common signaling pathways that include proliferation, development, toxicity, immune function, metabolism and detoxification. These pathways may be utilized to evaluate candidate compounds for potential favorable, or unfavorable, effects on melanoma-associated gene expression. Here we present the logistics of using medaka to screen compounds, as well as, the development of a user-friendly NanoString data analysis pipeline to support feasibility of this novel TDS drug-screening strategy.","authors":"Yuan Lu; William Boswell; Mikki Boswell; Barbara Klotz; Susanne Kneitz; Janine Regneri; Markita Savage; Cristina Mendoza; John Postlethwait; Wesley C.

The negative outcomes of these collisions should lead to selection against head-on alleles, maximizing genome co-orientation. Our findings challenge this model. Using the GC skew calculation, we reveal the evolutionary inversion record of all chromosomally encoded genes in multiple divergent bacterial pathogens. Against expectations, we find that a large number of co-oriented genes have inverted to the head-on orientation, presumably increasing the frequency of head-on replication-transcription conflicts. Furthermore, we find that head-on genes, (including key antibiotic resistance and virulence genes) have higher rates of non-synonymous mutations and are more frequently under positive selection (dN/dS \u003e 1). Based on these results, we propose that spontaneous gene inversions can increase the evolvability and pathogenic capacity of bacteria through head-on replication-transcription collisions. Head-on replication-transcription collisions occur within genes encoded on the lagging DNA strand. Here, the authors show that a large number of originally co-oriented (leading strand) genes have inverted to the head-on orientation, increasing both gene-specific mutation rates, and the overall evolvability of several bacterial pathogens.","authors":"Christopher N.

{"abstract":"Exposure of the brain to high-intensity stress waves creates the potential for long-term functional deficits not related to thermal or cavitational damage. Possible sources of such exposure include overpressure from blast explosions or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). While current ultrasound clinical protocols do not normally produce long-term neurological deficits, the rapid expansion of potential therapeutic applications and ultrasound pulse-train protocols highlights the importance of establishing a safety envelope beyond which therapeutic ultrasound can cause neurological deficits not detectable by standard histological assessment for thermal and cavitational damage. In this study, we assessed the neuroinflammatory response, behavioral effects, and brain micro-electrocorticographic (µECoG) signals in mice following exposure to a train of transcranial pulses above normal clinical parameters. We found that the HIFU exposure induced a mild regional neuroinflammation not localized to the primary focal site, and impaired locomotor and exploratory behavior for up to 1 month post-exposure. In addition, low frequency (δ) and high frequency (β, γ) oscillations recorded by ECoG were altered at acute and chronic time points following HIFU application. ECoG signal changes on the hemisphere ipsilateral to HIFU exposure are of greater magnitude than the contralateral hemisphere, and persist for up to three months. These results are useful for describing the upper limit of transcranial ultrasound protocols, and the neurological sequelae of injury induced by high-intensity stress waves.","authors":"Meijun Ye; Krystyna Solarana; Harmain Rafi; Shyama Patel; Marjan Nabili; Yunbo Liu; Stanley Huang; Jonathan A.

{"abstract":"Many applications of terahertz (THz) technology require the ability to actively manipulate a free space THz beam. Yet, although there have been many reports on the development of devices for THz signal processing, few of these include the possibility of electrical control of the functionality, and novel ideas are needed for active and reconfigurable THz devices. Here, we introduce a new approach, based on the integration of electrically actuated liquid metal components in THz waveguides. This versatile platform offers many possibilities for control of THz spectral content, wave fron\"ts, polarization, and power flow. We demonstrate two illustrative examples: the first active power-splitting switch, and the first channel add–drop filter. We show that both of these devices can be used to electrically switch THz communication signals while preserving the information in a high bit-rate-modulated data stream. Although there are many reports on the development of devices for terahertz signal processing, the possibility of electrical control of the functionality remains elusive. Here, the authors use electrically actuated liquid metal components incorporated into terahertz waveguides for controlling power flow and for frequency filtering.","authors":"Kimberly S.

{"abstract":"The microbiome of a vineyard may play a critical role in fruit development, and consequently, may impact quality properties of grape and wine. Vineyard management approaches that have directly manipulated the microbiome of grape clusters have been studied, but little is known about how vineyard management practices that impact the soil microbial pool can influence this dynamic. We examined three under-vine soil management practices: 1) herbicide application, 2) soil cultivation (vegetation removal), and 3) natural vegetation (no vegetation removal) in a Riesling vineyard in New York over a three-year period. The microbiomes associated with soil and grapes were profiled using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and fungal ITS regions. Our results showed that soil bacterial composition under natural vegetation differs from that seen in glyphosate-maintained bare soil. Soil fungal composition under the natural vegetation treatment was distinct from other treatments. Although our study revealed soil microbiome shifts based on under-vine management, there were no corresponding changes in fruit-associated microbial composition. These results suggested that other vineyard management practices or environmental factors are more influential in shaping the grape-associated microbiome.","authors":"Ming-Yi Chou; Justine Vanden Heuvel; Terrence H.

{"abstract":"It is well accepted that environmental heterogeneity and dispersal are key factors determining soil bacterial community composition, yet little is known about the role of local biotic interactions. Here we address this issue with an abundance-manipulation experiment that was conducted in a semiarid grassland. We manually increased the abundance of six randomly chosen resident bacterial species in separate, closed, communities and allowed the communities to recover in situ for 1 year. The single episode of increase in the abundance of different species drove species-specific community divergence accompanied by a decline in local diversity. Four of the six added species caused a decrease in the abundance of their closely related species, suggesting an important role of interspecific competition in driving the observed community divergence. Our results also suggested a lack of effective population regulations to force the relative abundance of manipulated species to revert to original level, which would allow persistence of the divergence among soil bacterial communities. We concluded that biotic interactions were important in determining soil bacterial community composition, which could result in substantial variation in soil bacterial community composition in abiotically homogenous environment.","authors":"Xin-Feng Zhao; Yi-Qi Hao; Da-Yong Zhang; Quan-Guo Zhang","keywords":"Community ecology; Microbial ecology","organization_affiliated":"School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and MOE Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and MOE Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and MOE Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology and MOE Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China","title":"Local biotic interactions drive species-specific divergence in soil bacterial communities","id":"02f25921-3beb-478a-93d2-c26b39a5366f"}
{"abstract":"The nature of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) variants determines residual enzyme activity, which modifies the clinical phenotype in phenylketonuria (PKU). We exploited the statistical power of a large genotype database to determine the relationship between genotype and phenotype in PKU. A total of 9336 PKU patients with 2589 different genotypes, carrying 588 variants, were investigated using an allelic phenotype value (APV) algorithm. We identified 251 0-variants encoding inactive PAH, and assigned APVs (0 = classic PKU; 5 = mild PKU; 10 = mild hyperphenylalaninaemia) to 88 variants in PAH-functional hemizygous patients. The genotypic phenotype values (GPVs) were set equal to the higher-APV allele, which was assumed to be dominant over the lower-APV allele and to determine the metabolic phenotype. GPVs for 8872 patients resulted in cut-off ranges of 0.0–2.7 for classic PKU, 2.8–6.6 for mild PKU and 6.7–10.0 for mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. Genotype-based phenotype prediction was 99.2% for classic PKU, 46.2% for mild PKU and 89.5% for mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. The relationships between known pretreatment blood phenylalanine levels and GPVs (n = 4217), as well as tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness and GPVs (n = 3488), were significant (both P \u003c 0.001). APV and GPV are powerful tools to investigate genotype–phenotype associations, and can be used for genetic counselling of PKU families.","authors":"Sven F.

{"abstract":"Topological semimetals host electronic structures with several band-contact points or lines and are generally expected to exhibit strong topological responses. Up to now, most work has been limited to non-magnetic materials and the interplay between topology and magnetism in this class of quantum materials has been largely unexplored. Here we utilize theoretical calculations, magnetotransport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to propose Fe3GeTe2, a van der Waals material, as a candidate ferromagnetic (FM) nodal line semimetal. We find that the spin degree of freedom is fully quenched by the large FM polarization, but the line degeneracy is protected by crystalline symmetries that connect two orbitals in adjacent layers. This orbital-driven nodal line is tunable by spin orientation due to spin–orbit coupling and produces a large Berry curvature, which leads to a large anomalous Hall current, angle and factor. These results demonstrate that FM topological semimetals hold significant potential for spin- and orbital-dependent electronic functionalities. A combined experimental and theoretical approach identifies the van der Waals material Fe3GeTe2 as a candidate ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal. These results extend the connections between topology and magnetism.","authors":"Kyoo Kim; Junho Seo; Eunwoo Lee; K.-T. Ko; B. S.

{"abstract":"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been successfully used to deliver gene therapy to improve auditory function in mouse models of hereditary hearing loss. Many forms of hereditary hearing loss have mutations which affect the cochlear hair cells, the mechanosensory cells which allow for sound detection and processing. While most conventional AAVs infect inner hair cells (IHCs) with various efficiencies, they infect outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells at lower levels in the cochlea. Here we examine the infection patterns of two synthetic AAVs (AAV2.7m8 and AAV8BP2) in the mouse inner ear. AAV2.7m8 infects both IHCs and OHCs with high efficiency. In addition, AAV2.7m8 infects inner pillar cells and inner phalangeal cells with high efficiency. Our results suggest that AAV2.7m8 is an excellent viral vector for inner ear gene therapy targeting cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, and it will likely greatly expand the potential applications for inner ear gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus is used in gene therapy in mouse models of hearing loss.

{"abstract":"Neuroimmunology and immunometabolism are burgeoning topics of study, but the intersection of these two fields is scarcely considered. This interplay is particularly prevalent within adipose tissue, where immune cells and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have an important role in metabolic homeostasis and pathology, namely in obesity. In the present Review, we first outline the established reciprocal adipose–SNS relationship comprising the neuroendocrine loop facilitated primarily by adipose tissue-derived leptin and SNS-derived noradrenaline. Next, we review the extensive crosstalk between adipocytes and resident innate immune cells as well as the changes that occur in these secretory and signalling pathways in obesity. Finally, we discuss the effect of SNS adrenergic signalling in immune cells and conclude with exciting new research demonstrating an immutable role for SNS-resident macrophages in modulating SNS–adipose crosstalk. We posit that the latter point constitutes the existence of a new field — neuroimmunometabolism. This Review provides an overview of the extensive crosstalk between adipocytes, resident innate immune cells and the sympathetic nerves that innervate adipose tissue, as well as the changes that occur in these secretory and signalling pathways in obesity.

{"abstract":" Escherichia coli that are capable of causing human disease are often classified into pathogenic variants (pathovars) based on their virulence gene content. However, disease-associated hybrid E. coli, containing unique combinations of multiple canonical virulence factors have also been described. Such was the case of the E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in 2011, which caused significant morbidity and mortality. Among the pathovars of diarrheagenic E. coli that cause significant human disease﻿ are the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). In the current study we use comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to characterize isolates that contain virulence factors of both EPEC and ETEC. Based on phylogenomic analysis, these hybrid isolates are more genomically-related to EPEC, but appear to have acquired ETEC virulence genes. Global transcriptional analysis using RNA sequencing, demonstrated that the EPEC and ETEC virulence genes of these hybrid isolates were differentially-expressed under virulence-inducing laboratory conditions, similar to reference isolates. Immunoblot assays further verified that the virulence gene products were produced and that the T3SS effector EspB of EPEC, and heat-labile toxin of ETEC were secreted. These findings document the existence and virulence potential of an E. coli pathovar hybrid that blurs the distinction between E. coli pathovars.","authors":"Tracy H.

{"abstract":"Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) exposure induces oxidative stress and epithelial cell-derived inflammation, which affect the pathogenesis of TDI-induced occupational asthma (TDI-OA). Recent studies suggested a role for clusterin (CLU) and progranulin (PGRN) in oxidative stress-mediated airway inflammation. To evaluate CLU and PGRN involvement in airway inflammation in TDI-OA, we measured their serum levels in patients with TDI-OA, asymptomatic exposed controls (AECs), and unexposed healthy normal controls (NCs). Serum CLU and PGRN levels were significantly lower in the TDI-OA group than in the AEC and NC groups (P \u003c 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting the TDI-OA phenotype were 72.4% and 53.4% when either CLU or PGRN levels were below the cutoff values (≤125 μg/mL and ≤68.4 ng/mL, respectively). If both parameters were below the cutoff levels, the sensitivity and specificity were 58.6% and 89.8%, respectively. To investigate CLU and PGRN function, we evaluated their production by human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) in response to TDI exposure and co-culturing with neutrophils. TDI-human serum albumin stimulation induced significant CLU/PGRN release from HAECs in a dose-dependent manner, which positively correlated with IL-8 and folliculin levels. Co-culturing with neutrophils significantly decreased CLU/PGRN production by HAECs. Intracellular ROS production in epithelial cells co-cultured with neutrophils tended to increase initially, but the ROS production decreased gradually at a higher ratio of neutrophils. Our results suggest that CLU and PGRN may be involved in TDI-OA pathogenesis by protecting against TDI-induced oxidative stress-mediated inflammation. The combined CLU/PGRN serum level may be used as a potential serological marker for identifying patients with TDI-OA among TDI-exposed workers. Tracking the levels of two key proteins in workers’ blood may help identify those at risk of occupational asthma (OA). Exposure to toxic chemicals such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI), used in industrial foams and paints, can trigger OA. The condition often has a poor prognosis yet remains difficult to diagnose. Hae-Sim Park at Ajou University in Suwon, South Korea, and co-workers have pinpointed two proteins, clusterin and progranulin, the levels of which could indicate if a person is suffering from OA. The team measured serum levels in patients with TDI-OA, controls exposed to TDI with no symptoms and healthy un-exposed controls. Both clusterin and progranulin levels were significantly lower in TDI-OA patients than in both control groups. These two serum markers may help diagnose workers with OA and also identify those most at risk.","authors":"Gil-Soon Choi; Hoang Kim Tu Trinh; Eun-Mi Yang; Young-Min Ye; Yoo Seob Shin; Seung-Hyun Kim; Hae-Sim Park","keywords":"Asthma; Diagnostic markers; Immunopathogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Department of Internal Medicine, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea","title":"Role of clusterin/progranulin in toluene diisocyanate-induced occupational asthma","id":"64c8a2f8-375a-4be1-bd3d-a7e685a164a4"}
{"abstract":"Phenotypic diversification is key to microbial adaptation. Currently, advanced technological approaches offer insights into cell-to-cell variation of bacterial populations at a spatiotemporal resolution. However, the underlying molecular causes or consequences often remain obscure. In this study, we developed a workflow combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-sequencing, thereby allowing transcriptomic analysis of 106 bacterial cells. As a proof of concept, the workflow was applied to study prophage induction in a subpopulation of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Remarkably, both the phage genes and flanking genomic regions of the CGP3 prophage revealed significantly increased coverage upon prophage induction – a phenomenon that to date has been obscured by bulk approaches. Genome sequencing of prophage-induced populations suggested regional replication at the CGP3 locus in C. glutamicum. Finally, the workflow was applied to unravel iron-triggered prophage induction in early exponential cultures. Here, an up-shift in iron levels resulted in a heterogeneous response of an SOS (PdivS) reporter. RNA-sequencing of the induced subpopulation confirmed induction of the SOS response triggering also activation of the CGP3 prophage. The fraction of CGP3-induced cells was enhanced in a mutant lacking the iron regulator DtxR suffering from enhanced iron uptake. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the potential of the established workflow to gain insights into the phenotypic dynamics of bacterial populations.","authors":"Raphael Freiherr von Boeselager; Eugen Pfeifer; Julia Frunzke","keywords":"Bacteriophages; Microbial communities; Gene expression analysis; Phage biology","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Bio- und Geosciences, IBG-1: Biotechnology, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany; Institute of Bio- und Geosciences, IBG-1: Biotechnology, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany; Institute of Bio- und Geosciences, IBG-1: Biotechnology, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany","title":"Cytometry meets next-generation sequencing – RNA-Seq of sorted subpopulations reveals regional replication and iron-triggered prophage induction in Corynebacterium glutamicum","id":"e6373717-0a93-4aae-bda5-9324b034183c"}
{"abstract":"Amputated patients are hardly satisfied with upper limb prostheses, and tend to favour the use of their contralateral arm to partially compensate their disability. This may seem surprising in light of recent evidences that external objects (rubber hand or tool) can easily be embodied, namely incorporated in the body representation. We investigated both implicit body representations (by evaluating the peripersonal space using a reachability judgement task) and the quality of bodily integration of the patient’s prosthesis (assessed via questionnaires). As expected, the patients estimated that they could reach further while wearing their prosthesis, showing an embodiment of their prosthesis in their judgement. Yet, the real reaching space was found to be smaller with their prosthesis than with their healthy limb, showing a large error between reachability judgement and actual capacity. An overestimation was also found on the healthy side (comparatively to healthy subjects) suggesting a bilateral modification of body representation in amputated patients. Finally, a correlation was found between the quality of integration of the prosthesis and the way the body representation changed. This study therefore illustrates the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon of prosthesis integration, which involves its incorporation as a tool, but also various specific subjective aspects.","authors":"Adrienne Gouzien; Fréderique de Vignemont; Amélie Touillet; Noël Martinet; Jozina De Graaf; Nathanaël Jarrassé; Agnès Roby-Brami","keywords":"Human behaviour; Neuroscience; Psychology; Sensorimotor processing","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), Sorbonne University, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7222, INSERM U1150, Paris, France; Service de psychiatrie, Pôle Paris Centre, Hôpitaux de Saint-Maurice, Saint-Maurice, France; Service de psychiatrie, Pôle Paris Centre, Hôpitaux de Saint-Maurice, Saint-Maurice, France; Institut Jean Nicod, ENS – EHESS – CNRS UMR 8129, IEC, PSL, Paris, France; Louis Pierquin Centre of the Regional Institute of Rehabilitation, UGECAM Nord-est, Nancy, France; Louis Pierquin Centre of the Regional Institute of Rehabilitation, UGECAM Nord-est, Nancy, France; Institute of Movement Sciences (ISM), UMR 7287 - CNRS \u0026 Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France; Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), Sorbonne University, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7222, INSERM U1150, Paris, France; Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), Sorbonne University, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7222, INSERM U1150, Paris, France","title":"Reachability and the sense of embodiment in amputees using prostheses","id":"1d4c03bb-d36c-43af-b35c-7159b0737561"}
{"abstract":"Striatum processes a wide range of functions including goal-directed behavior and habit formation, respectively encoded by the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS). GABAergic feedforward inhibition is known to control the integration of cortical information by striatal projection neurons (SPNs). Here we questioned whether this control is specific between distinct striatal functional territories. Using opto-activation and opto-inhibition of identified GABAergic interneurons, we found that different circuits are engaged in DLS and DMS, both ex vivo and in vivo: while parvalbumin interneurons efficiently control SPNs in DLS, somatostatin interneurons control SPNs in DMS. Moreover, both parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons use a dual hyperpolarizing/depolarizing effect to control cortical input integration depending on SPN activity state: GABAergic interneurons potently inhibit spiking SPNs while in resting SPNs, they favor cortical activity summation via a depolarizing effect. Our findings establish that striatal GABAergic interneurons exert efficient territory-specific and state-dependent control of SPN activity and functional output. Striatal GABAergic interneurons regulate the influence of cortical inputs on striatal projection neurons through feedforward inhibition. Here, the authors report that this inhibition is mediated mainly by PV interneurons in the dorsolateral striatum and SOM interneurons in the dorsomedial striatum.","authors":"Elodie Fino; Marie Vandecasteele; Sylvie Perez; Frédéric Saudou; Laurent Venance","keywords":"Inhibition; Neural circuits","organization_affiliated":"Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, CNRS UMR7241, INSERM U1050, Paris, France; Université Pierre et Marie Curie, ED 158, Paris Sciences et Lettres, Paris, France; INSERM U1216, Grenoble, France; Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience, Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, CNRS UMR7241, INSERM U1050, Paris, France; Université Pierre et Marie Curie, ED 158, Paris Sciences et Lettres, Paris, France; Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, CNRS UMR7241, INSERM U1050, Paris, France; Université Pierre et Marie Curie, ED 158, Paris Sciences et Lettres, Paris, France; INSERM U1216, Grenoble, France; Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience, Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, CNRS UMR7241, INSERM U1050, Paris, France; Université Pierre et Marie Curie, ED 158, Paris Sciences et Lettres, Paris, France","title":"Region-specific and state-dependent action of striatal GABAergic interneurons","id":"e43d175a-65c4-4b5d-8f7e-e30024a76b6e"}
{"abstract":"Bovine mastitis is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is difficult to eliminate, prone to escape from antibacterial agents, and may cause recurring infections due to the intracellular nature of its infection and multidrug resistance. In this study, the intracellular activities of the NZ2114 derivative peptide H18R (H2) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant bovine S. aureus strains were investigated in bovine mammary epithelial MAC-T cells and mouse mammary glands. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of H2 against S. aureus were 0.5‒1 μg/ml; H2 displayed a lower cytotoxicity than its parental peptide NZ2114 (survival rates of MAC-T cells: 100% [H2 treatment] vs 60.7% [NZ2114 (256 μg/ml) treatment]). H2 was internalized into MAC-T cells mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and distributed in the cytoplasm. The intracellular inhibition rates against MRSA ATCC43300, the mastitis isolates S. aureus CVCC 3051 and E48 were above 99%, 99%, and 94%, respectively; these were higher than those in case of vancomycin (23–47%). In the mouse model of S. aureus E48-induced mastitis, after treatment with 100 μg of H2 and vancomycin, bacterial numbers in each mammary gland were reduced by 3.96- and 1.59-log CFU, respectively. Additionally, similar to NZ2114 and vancomycin, H2 alleviated the histopathological damage of the mammary tissue and polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration in the alveoli. These results suggest that H2 can be used as a safe and effective candidate for treating S. aureus-induced mastitis.","authors":"Xiao Wang; Da Teng; Xiumin Wang; Ya Hao; Huixian Chen; Ruoyu Mao; Jianhua Wang","keywords":"Antimicrobials; Cellular imaging","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Feed Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Gene Engineering Laboratory, Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China","title":"Internalization, distribution, and activity of peptide H2 against the intracellular multidrug-resistant bovine mastitis-causing bacterium Staphylococcus aureus","id":"f2b5921f-5990-48f1-aaa6-808954ca7aba"}
{"abstract":"Deoxynucleotidyl transferase terminal interacting protein 1 (DNTTIP1) forms a complex with histone deacetylase (HDAC); however, the relevance of DNTTIP1 in cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine DNTTIP1 expression and its functional mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). DNTTIP1 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of DNTTIP1 was upregulated significantly in vitro and in vivo, and in patients with OSCC in whom DNTTIP1 was overexpressed and the expression level was correlated significantly (P \u003c 0.05) with tumoral growth. DNTTIP1 knockdown (siDNTTIP1) cells showed depressed cellular proliferation by cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase with high acetylation of p53 and upregulation of p21Cip1. Moreover, resveratrol, a HDAC inhibitor, controlled not only acetylated p53 status but also DNTTIP1 expression, leading to a similar phenotype of siDNTTIP1 cells. A marked (P \u003c 0.05) reduction of tumoral growth in mouse xenograft models was observed with lower DNTTIP1 expression under the presence of this chemical reagent. Taken together, our results suggested that DNTTIP1–HDAC interaction promotes tumoral growth through deacetylation of p53 and that DNTTIP1 might be a critical therapeutic target in OSCCs. This study demonstrates that deoxynucleotidyl transferase terminal interacting protein 1 (DNTTIP1), a binding partner of histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays a crucial role in progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by controlling p53 acetylation. Resveratrol, a HDAC inhibitor, controls both acetylated p53 status and DNTTIP1 expression. Thus, DNTTIP1 might be a novel therapeutic target in OSCC.","authors":"Yuki Sawai; Atsushi Kasamatsu; Dai Nakashima; Kazuaki Fushimi; Hiroki Kasama; Manabu Iyoda; Yukinao Kouzu; Masashi Shiiba; Hideki Tanzawa; Katsuhiro Uzawa","keywords":"Oral cancer; Tumour biomarkers","organization_affiliated":"Department of Oral Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Eastern Chiba Medical Center, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Eastern Chiba Medical Center, Chiba, Japan; Division of Oral Surgery, Chiba Rosai Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Division of Dentistry, Chiba Children’s Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Medical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Oral Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Oral Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan","title":"Critical role of deoxynucleotidyl transferase terminal interacting protein 1 in oral cancer","id":"7580a0f5-32a8-4b3e-8f04-2c3347e34970"}

{"abstract":"Recent in vitro studies have shown that some chemical UV filters mimic the effect of progesterone in the activation of the CatSper Ca2+ channel in human spermatozoa. However, so far, the extent of exposure of human spermatozoa to chemical UV filters via the presence of these chemicals in seminal fluid has been unknown. Here, we present levels of UV filters measured in human seminal fluid and comparisons to levels measured in concurrently collected urine and serum samples. In total nine UV filters were analysed by TurboFlow-LC–MS/MS in paired urine, serum, and seminal fluid samples from 300 young Danish men from the general population; each man collected one of each sample type within 1 h. The samples were collected during February–December 2013 and only six of the men reported having used sunscreen during the 48 h preceding the sample collection. Four of the examined UV filters could be detected in seminal fluid samples at levels above LOD in more than 10% of the samples. Benzophenone (BP), benzophenone-1 (BP-1), and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) were most frequently detected in, respectively, 18%, 19%, and 27% of the seminal fluid samples albeit at levels one to two orders of magnitude lower than the levels observed in urine. 4-methyl-benzophenone (4-MBP) was detectable in 11% of the seminal fluid samples while in \u003c5% of the urine samples. Overall 45% of the men had at least one of the UV filters present in their seminal fluid at detectable levels. For BP-1 and BP-3 individual levels in urine and seminal fluid were significantly correlated, while this was not evident for BP nor 4-MBP. In conclusion, chemical UV filters are present in men’s seminal fluid; some of which can activate the human sperm-specific CatSper Ca2+ channel and thereby potentially interfere with the fertilisation process.","authors":"Hanne Frederiksen; Marianna Krause; Niels Jørgensen; Anders Rehfeld; Niels E.

{"abstract":"The ability to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) information about morphologies of nanostructures elucidates many interesting properties of materials in both physical and biological sciences. Here we demonstrate a novel method in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that gives a fast and reliable assessment of the 3-D configuration of curvilinear nano﻿structures, all without needing to tilt the sample through an arc. Using one-dimensional crystalline defects known as dislocations as a prototypical example of a complex curvilinear object, we demonstrate their 3-D reconstruction two orders of magnitude faster than by standard tilt-arc TEM tomographic techniques, from data recorded by selecting different ray paths of the convergent STEM probe. Due to its speed and immunity to problems associated with a tilt arc, the tilt-less 3-D imaging offers important advantages for investigations of radiation-sensitive, polycrystalline, or magnetic materials. Further, by using a segmented detector, the total electron dose is reduced to a single STEM raster scan acquisition; our tilt-less approach will therefore open new avenues for real-time 3-D electron imaging of dynamic processes.","authors":"Emad Oveisi; Antoine Letouzey; Duncan T.

{"abstract":"Amorphous Silicon-Tin-Oxide thin film transistors (a-STO TFTs) with Mo source/drain electrodes were fabricated. The introduction of a ~8 nm MoOx interlayer between Mo electrodes and a-STO improved the electron injection in a-STO TFT. Mo adjacent to the a-STO semiconductor mainly gets oxygen atoms from the oxygen-rich surface of a-STO film to form MoOx interlayer. The self-formed MoOx interlayer acting as an efficient interface modification layer could conduce to the stepwise internal transport barrier formation while blocking Mo atoms diffuse into a-STO layer, which would contribute to the formation of ohmic contact between Mo and a-STO film. It can effectively improve device performance, reduce cost and save energy for the realization of large-area display with high resolution in future.","authors":"Xianzhe Liu; Hua Xu; Honglong Ning; Kuankuan Lu; Hongke Zhang; Xiaochen Zhang; Rihui Yao; Zhiqiang Fang; Xubing Lu; Junbiao Peng","keywords":"Ceramics; Electronic devices","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Institute for Advanced Materials and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Quantum Engineering and Quantum Materials, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, Department of Materials Science and Engineering School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","title":"Induced nano-scale self-formed metal-oxide interlayer in amorphous silicon tin oxide thin film transistors","id":"8a9051ae-bdca-4644-b9b4-aa3e8f4ddd26"}
{"abstract":"Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) with activity towards a broad-spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics have become a major threat to public health, not least due to their ability to rapidly adapt their substrate preference. In this study, the capability of the MBL AIM-1 to evade antibiotic pressure by introducing specific mutations was probed by two alternative methods, i.e. site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM) of active site residues and in vitro evolution. Both approaches demonstrated that a single mutation in AIM-1 can greatly enhance a pathogen’s resistance towards broad spectrum antibiotics without significantly compromising the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Importantly, the evolution experiments demonstrated that relevant amino acids are not necessarily in close proximity to the catalytic centre of the enzyme. This observation is a powerful demonstration that MBLs have a diverse array of possibilities to adapt to new selection pressures, avenues that cannot easily be predicted from a crystal structure alone.","authors":"Chun-Feng D.

{"abstract":"In stark contrast to common ice, Ih, water ice at planetary interior conditions has been predicted to become superionic with fast-diffusing (that is, liquid-like) hydrogen ions moving within a solid lattice of oxygen. Likely to constitute a large fraction of icy giant planets, this extraordinary phase has not been observed in the laboratory. Here, we report laser-driven shock-compression experiments on water ice VII. Using time-resolved optical pyrometry and laser velocimetry measurements as well as supporting density functional theory–molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations, we document the shock equation of state of H2O to unprecedented extreme conditions and unravel thermodynamic signatures showing that ice melts near 5,000 K at 190 GPa. Optical reflectivity and absorption measurements also demonstrate the low electronic conductivity of ice, which, combined with previous measurements of the total electrical conductivity under reverberating shock compression, provides experimental evidence for superionic conduction in water ice at planetary interior conditions, verifying a 30-year-old prediction. Although predicted to occur in planetary interiors, superionic water ice has proved elusive to identify experimentally.

{"abstract":"Members of a family of marine dsDNA non-tailed bacterial viruses have short, 10-kb genomes, infect a broader range of hosts than tailed viruses and belong to the double jelly roll capsid lineage of viruses, which are associated with diverse bacterial and archaeal hosts. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses comprise both tailed and non-tailed viruses and are thought to be the most abundant viruses on Earth. Tailed viruses of the Caudovirales dominate sequence and culture collections, whereas non-tailed dsDNA viruses often dominate ocean samples but remain largely uncharacterized. Martin Polz and colleagues describe a family of diverse marine non-tailed viruses, called the Autolykiviridae. Through metagenomics and phylogenetic analyses, the team show that Autolykiviridae represent an ancient lineage of double jelly roll capsid viruses. They also show that these viruses are abundant in the ocean, where they prey on marine bacteria and archaea. This finding was facilitated by updated methods for environmental viral discovery, and represents an important step forwards in our understanding of environmental bacteria–virus interactions. The most abundant viruses on Earth are thought to be double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that infect bacteria1. However, tailed bacterial dsDNA viruses (Caudovirales), which dominate sequence and culture collections, are not representative of the environmental diversity of viruses2,3. In fact, non-tailed viruses often dominate ocean samples numerically4, raising the fundamental question of the nature of these viruses. Here we characterize a group of marine dsDNA non-tailed viruses with short 10-kb genomes isolated during a study that quantified the diversity of viruses infecting Vibrionaceae bacteria. These viruses, which we propose to name the Autolykiviridae, represent a novel family within the ancient lineage of double jelly roll (DJR) capsid viruses. Ecologically, members of the Autolykiviridae have a broad host range, killing on average 34 hosts in four Vibrio species, in contrast to tailed viruses which kill on average only two hosts in one species. Biochemical and physical characterization of autolykiviruses reveals multiple virion features that cause systematic loss of DJR viruses in sequencing and culture-based studies, and we describe simple procedural adjustments to recover them. We identify DJR viruses in the genomes of diverse major bacterial and archaeal phyla, and in marine water column and sediment metagenomes, and find that their diversity greatly exceeds the diversity that is currently captured by the three recognized families of such viruses. Overall, these data suggest that viruses of the non-tailed dsDNA DJR lineage are important but often overlooked predators of bacteria and archaea that impose fundamentally different predation and gene transfer regimes on microbial systems than on tailed viruses, which form the basis of all environmental models of bacteria–virus interactions.","authors":"Kathryn M.

{"abstract":"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) translocates antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. This is a key step in the control of viral infections through CD8+ T-cells. The herpes simplex virus type-1 encodes an 88 amino acid long species-specific TAP inhibitor, ICP47, that functions as a high affinity competitor for the peptide binding site on TAP. It has previously been suggested that the inhibitory function of ICP47 resides within the N-terminal region (residues 1–35). Here we show that mutation of the highly conserved 50PLL52 motif within the central region of ICP47 attenuates its inhibitory capacity. Taking advantage of the human cytomegalovirus-encoded TAP inhibitor US6 as a luminal sensor for conformational changes of TAP, we demonstrated that the 50PLL52 motif is essential for freezing of the TAP conformation. Moreover, hierarchical functional interaction sites on TAP dependent on 50PLL52 could be defined using a comprehensive set of human-rat TAP chimeras. This data broadens our understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning TAP inhibition by ICP47, to include the 50PLL52 sequence as a stabilizer that tethers the TAP-ICP47 complex in an inward-facing conformation.","authors":"Tony Matschulla; Richard Berry; Carolin Gerke; Marius Döring; Julia Busch; Jennifer Paijo; Ulrich Kalinke; Frank Momburg; Hartmut Hengel; Anne Halenius","keywords":"Immune evasion; MHC class I","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Virology, Medical Center – University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Infection and Immunity Program, Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Monash University, Clayton, Australia; Institute of Virology, Medical Center – University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany; Institute for Experimental Infection Research, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, a joint venture between the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and the Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Institute of Virology, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany; Institute for Experimental Infection Research, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, a joint venture between the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and the Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Institute for Experimental Infection Research, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, a joint venture between the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and the Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Unit, Applied Tumor Immunity, Antigen Presentation and T/NK Cell Activation Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Virology, Medical Center – University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Virology, Medical Center – University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany","title":"A highly conserved sequence of the viral TAP inhibitor ICP47 is required for freezing of the peptide transport cycle","id":"76562510-37ca-4768-81d1-b195557ba597"}
{"abstract":"Increasing evidence supports a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Maintaining the initial clinical response after ketamine infusion in TRD is a crucial next-step challenge. D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the glycine co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, is potentially effective as a depression augmentation treatment. However, whether DCS maintains the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion remains unknown. In all, 32 patients with TRD (17 with major depression and 15 with bipolar depression) who responded to ketamine infusion with an average 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 9.47 ± 4.11 at baseline were randomly divided to 6-week DCS treatment (250 mg for 2 days, 500 mg for 2 days, 750 mg for 3 days, and 1000 mg for 5 weeks) and placebo groups. Depression symptoms were rated at timepoints of dose titration and weekly. During the 6-week treatment, the total scores of HAMD did not differ between the DCS and placebo groups. The results remained consistent when stratified by disorder. A mixed model analysis indicated that the DCS group exhibited lower scores of HAMD item 3 (suicide) compared with the placebo group throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.01). A superior maintenance of the antisuicidal effect of ketamine was observed in the DCS group than in the placebo group. DCS may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with TRD who responded to ketamine infusion but have a residual suicidal risk.","authors":"Mu-Hong Chen; Chih-Ming Cheng; Ralitza Gueorguieva; Wei-Chen Lin; Cheng-Ta Li; Chen-Jee Hong; Pei-Chi Tu; Ya-Mei Bai; Shih-Jen Tsai; John H.

{"abstract":"We report a theoretical and experimental study of coupling between a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microdisk resonator and a fiber taper which exchange energies at two distinct regions. We observe an oscillatory behavior in the coupling strength as a function of the distance between the two coupling regions when a fiber taper is moved laterally above the resonator at fixed vertical distance. This oscillation is clearly seen in the linewidth of the resonance as well as in the on-resonance transmission. A theoretical model considering for two-point coupling successfully explains the experimental observations as being a result of the interference between the light fields coupled into and out of the resonator at two distinct regions and the light transmitted through the waveguide. Critical coupling in two-region coupling is a collective result of the coupling at two different coupling regions, and does not require critical coupling at both or at any one of the two coupling regions. This relaxes the conditions for achieving critical coupling in waveguide-resonator systems. The discovery of this previously unnoticed oscillatory behavior in two-region coupling between a WGM resonator and a waveguide will benefit both fundamental studies and practical applications based on WGM resonators.","authors":"Fang Bo; Şahin Kaya Özdemir; Faraz Monifi; Jing Zhang; Guoquan Zhang; Jingjun Xu; Lan Yang","keywords":"Microresonators; Optical techniques","organization_affiliated":"The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, TEDA Institute of Applied Physics and School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; The Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China; Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, USA; Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, USA; Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, TEDA Institute of Applied Physics and School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; The Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China; The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, TEDA Institute of Applied Physics and School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; The Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China; Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, USA","title":"Controllable oscillatory lateral coupling in a waveguide-microdisk-resonator system","id":"4b23716d-dc8b-4322-8f89-af5db658fd3e"}
{"abstract":"TMPRSS6, also known as matriptase-2, is a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a major role in iron homeostasis by acting as a negative regulator of hepcidin production through cleavage of the BMP co-receptor haemojuvelin. Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA), an iron metabolism disorder, is associated with mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene. By analysing RNA-seq data encoding TMPRSS6 isoforms and other proteins involved in hepcidin production, we uncovered significant differences in expression levels between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and normal human liver samples. Most notably, TMPRSS6 and HAMP expression was found to be much lower in HepG2 and Huh7 cells when compared to human liver samples. Furthermore, we characterized the common TMPRSS6 polymorphism V736A identified in Hep3B cells, the V795I mutation found in HepG2 cells, also associated with IRIDA, and the G603R substitution recently detected in two IRIDA patients. While variant V736A is as active as wild-type TMPRSS6, mutants V795I and G603R displayed significantly reduced proteolytic activity. Our results provide important information about commonly used liver cell models and shed light on the impact of two TMPRSS6 mutations associated with IRIDA.","authors":"Sébastien P.

{"abstract":"During the evolution into castration or therapy resistance, prostate cancer cells reprogram the androgen responses to cope with the diminishing level of androgens, and undergo metabolic adaption to the nutritionally deprived and hypoxia conditions. AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8’s oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8’s functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells.","authors":"Hung-Jung Wang; Mamata Pochampalli; Ling-Yu Wang; June X Zou; Pei-Shan Li; Sheng-Chieh Hsu; Bi-Juan Wang; Shih-Han Huang; Ping Yang; Joy C.

{"abstract":"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder with a population incidence of ~1/5000 live births, defined by an absence of enteric ganglia along variable lengths of the colon. HSCR genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found common associated variants at RET, SEMA3, and NRG1, but they still fail to explain all of its heritability. To enhance gene discovery, we performed a GWAS of 170 cases identified from the Danish nationwide pathology registry with 4717 controls, based on 6.2 million variants imputed from the haplotype reference consortium panel. We found a novel low-frequency variant (rs144432435), which, when conditioning on the lead RET single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), was of genome-wide significance in the discovery analysis. This conditional association signal was replicated in a Swedish HSCR cohort with discovery plus replication meta-analysis conditional odds ratio of 6.6 (P = 7.7 × 10−10; 322 cases and 4893 controls). The conditional signal was, however, not replicated in two HSCR cohorts from USA and Finland, leading to the hypothesis that rs144432435 tags a rare haplotype present in Denmark and Sweden. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the SNP heritability of HSCR to be 88%, close to estimates based on classical family studies. Moreover, by using Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression we were able to construct a genetic HSCR predictor with a area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 76% in an independent validation set. In conclusion, we combined the largest collection of sporadic Hirschsprung cases to date (586 cases) to further elucidate HSCR’s genetic architecture.","authors":"João Fadista; Marie Lund; Line Skotte; Frank Geller; Priyanka Nandakumar; Sumantra Chatterjee; Hans Matsson; Anna Löf Granström; Tomas Wester; Perttu Salo; Valtter Virtanen; Lisbeth Carstensen; Jonas Bybjerg-Grauholm; David Michael Hougaard; Mikko Pakarinen; Markus Perola; Agneta Nordenskjöld; Aravinda Chakravarti; Mads Melbye; Bjarke Feenstra","keywords":"Genome-wide association studies; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA; McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA; Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Paediatric Surgery, Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Paediatric Surgery, Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland; Pediatric Surgery, Children’s Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Congenital Disorders, Danish Centre for Neonatal Screening, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Congenital Disorders, Danish Centre for Neonatal Screening, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Pediatric Surgery, Children’s Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Paediatric Surgery, Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Center of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark","title":"Genome-wide association study of Hirschsprung disease detects a novel low-frequency variant at the RET locus","id":"071c90a5-4ec7-48f0-a77d-6029cf4e9784"}
{"abstract":"Studies in learning communities have consistently found evidence that peer-interactions contribute to students’ performance outcomes. A particularly important competence in the modern context is the ability to communicate ideas effectively. One metric of this is speaking, which is an important skill in professional and casual settings. In this study, we explore peer-interaction effects in online networks on speaking skill development. In particular, we present an evidence for gradual buildup of skills in a small-group setting that has not been reported in the literature. Evaluating the development of such skills requires studying objective evidence, for which purpose, we introduce a novel dataset of six online communities consisting of 158 participants focusing on improving their speaking skills. They video-record speeches for 5 prompts in 10 days and exchange comments and performance-ratings with their peers. We ask (i) whether the participants’ ratings are affected by their interaction patterns with peers, and (ii) whether there is any gradual buildup of speaking skills in the communities towards homogeneity. To analyze the data, we employ tools from the emerging field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP). GSP enjoys a distinction from Social Network Analysis in that the latter is concerned primarily with the connection structures of graphs, while the former studies signals on top of graphs. We study the performance ratings of the participants as graph signals atop underlying interaction topologies. Total variation analysis of the graph signals show that the participants’ rating differences decrease with time (slope = −0.04, p \u003c 0.01), while average ratings increase (slope = 0.07, p \u003c 0.05)—thereby gradually building up the ratings towards community-wide homogeneity. We provide evidence for peer-influence through a prediction formulation. Our consensus-based prediction model outperforms baseline network-agnostic regression models by about 23% in predicting performance ratings. This in turn shows that participants’ ratings are affected by their peers’ ratings and the associated interaction patterns, corroborating previous findings. Then, we formulate a consensus-based diffusion model that captures these observations of peer-influence from our analyses. We anticipate that this study will open up future avenues for a broader exploration of peer-influenced skill development mechanisms, and potentially help design innovative interventions in small-groups to maximize peer-effects.","authors":"Rasoul Shafipour; Raiyan Abdul Baten; Md Kamrul Hasan; Gourab Ghoshal; Gonzalo Mateos; Mohammed Ehsan Hoque","keywords":"Complex networks; Science, technology and society","organization_affiliated":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA; Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA; Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, USA","title":"Buildup of speaking skills in an online learning community: a network-analytic exploration","id":"8443e793-8649-4d89-906b-e3c451e209ab"}

We aimed to evaluate the roles of frequent outpatient visits in prognosis of COPD. We used claims data in the national medical insurance review system provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015. A definition of COPD was used based on the diagnosis code and medication. Frequent visitors were defined as subjects who visited the outpatient clinic for COPD three or more times per year. Among 159,025 subjects, 117,483 (73.9%) were classified as frequent visitors. Frequent visitors underwent pulmonary function tests and used various inhalers more often than did infrequent visitors. The rates of COPD exacerbation requiring admission to a general ward, emergency room, or intensive care unit were significantly lower in frequent visitors than in infrequent visitors. In multivariable analysis, frequent visits were identified as an independent factor preventing COPD exacerbation that required admission to a ward (odds ratio [OR], 0.387), emergency room, (OR, 0.558), or intensive care unit (OR, 0.39) (all P \u003c 0.001).

{"abstract":"Network alignment (NA) compares networks with the goal of finding a node mapping that uncovers highly similar (conserved) network regions. Existing NA methods are homogeneous, i.e., they can deal only with networks containing nodes and edges of one type. Due to increasing amounts of heterogeneous network data with nodes or edges of different types, we extend three recent state-of-the-art homogeneous NA methods, WAVE, MAGNA++, and SANA, to allow for heterogeneous NA for the first time. We introduce several algorithmic novelties. Namely, these existing methods compute homogeneous graphlet-based node similarities and then find high-scoring alignments with respect to these similarities, while simultaneously maximizing the amount of conserved edges. Instead, we extend homogeneous graphlets to their heterogeneous counterparts, which we then use to develop a new measure of heterogeneous node similarity. Also, we extend S3, a state-of-the-art measure of edge conservation for homogeneous NA, to its heterogeneous counterpart. Then, we find high-scoring alignments with respect to our heterogeneous node similarity and edge conservation measures. In evaluations on synthetic and real-world biological networks, our proposed heterogeneous NA methods lead to higher-quality alignments and better robustness to noise in the data than their homogeneous counterparts.

{"abstract":"Monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1; also called Regnase-1) encoded by the ZC3H12A gene critically regulates inflammatory responses and immune homeostasis primarily by RNase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, the relationship of MCPIP1 with apoptosis and cancer and the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. The current study has demonstrated a previously uncovered connection between MCPIP1 and the negative regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5; also known as TRAIL-R2 or killer/DR5), a cell surface receptor for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is produced endogenously by various immune cells such as T cells. Our findings have revealed that MCPIP1 decreases both total cellular and cell surface DR5, primarily through modulating DUB-mediated protein autophagic/lysosomal degradation. Suppression of MCPIP1 by gene knockdown induces the formation of death-induced signaling complex (DISC) and enhances TRAIL or DR5 activation-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between MCPIP1 expression and DR5 expression/cell sensitivity to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Our findings warrant future investigation of the roles of negative regulation of DR5 by MCPIP1 in cancer and in T-cell immunity.","authors":"You-Take Oh; Guoqing Qian; Jiusheng Deng; Shi-Yong Sun","keywords":"Cancer; Post-translational modifications","organization_affiliated":"Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA; Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA; Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA; Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA","title":"Monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein-1 enhances DR5 degradation and negatively regulates DR5 activation-induced apoptosis through its deubiquitinase function","id":"9d381660-441c-4ebf-a6cc-d5cda34d6195"}

{"abstract":"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are among the most versatile nanomaterials, but their exploitation is hindered by limited dispersibility, especially in aqueous solvents. Here, we show that AP-LYS, a highly cationic soluble derivative of denatured hen egg lysozyme, is a very effective tool for the unbundling and solubilisation of CNTs. AP-LYS proved to mediate the complete and stable dispersion of CNTs at protein: CNT ratios ≥1: 3 (w:w) in very mild conditions (10–20 minutes sonication in ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0). Electrophoretic mobility and ζ-potential measurements confirmed that dispersed CNTs were coated by the protein, whereas molecular docking was used to study the interactions between AP-LYS and CNTs. AP-LYS-coated CNTs proved to be a very effective microbial cell-flocculating agent with an efficiency similar to that of chitosan, one of the best available flocculating agents, thus suggesting that this hybrid could find industrial applications in the treatment of wastewaters contaminated by microbial cells, or to remove microbial cells after fermentation processes. Moreover, we exploited the low stability of AP-LYS-coated CNT dispersions in eukaryotic cell culture media to prepare scaffolds with an extracellular matrix-like rough surface for the cultivation of eukaryotic cells.","authors":"Marialuisa Siepi; Giuliana Donadio; Principia Dardano; Luca De Stefano; Daria Maria Monti; Eugenio Notomista","keywords":"Bioinspired materials; Biomaterials – proteins; Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia, Naples, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia, Naples, Italy; Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems, Unit of Naples, National Research Council, Via P.

{"abstract":"The desire for cost-effective strategies for producing organic electronic devices has led to many new methods for the organic semiconductor layer deposition; however, manufacturing contacts remains an expensive technique due to the high cost of both the materials used and the processing necessary for their patterning. In this work, we present a method for contact deposition and patterning, which overcomes these limitations and allows fabrication of all-printed organic thin-film transistors on paper. The method relies on depositing contacts using aerosol spray and patterning them with a digitally printed mask from an office laser printer, at ambient temperature and pressure. This technique, which we have denoted aerosol spray laser lithography, is cost-effective and extremely versatile in terms of material choice and electrode geometry. As the processing temperature does not exceed 155 °C, it is compatible with a variety of substrates, including plastic or paper. The success of this method marks an opportunity for a rapid, scalable, and low-cost alternative to current electrode-manufacturing techniques for development of flexible, large-area, electronic applications. The power of commercial printers and spray coaters has been brought together to fasten the prototyping of flexible electronics. A collaborative team led by Prof Oana Jurchescu from Wake Forest University, US design an aerosol spray laser lithography approach to make patterned electrode arrays with low cost. The lithography step is realized by a desktop laser printer while the toner acts as the photoresist. The electrodes are deposited with spray coating of metal inks, followed by a heat-assisted transfer or peel-off process to finish the patterning. They then printed organic thin-film transistor arrays on paper and show that the devices work well under normal and bending conditions. This approach has proven successful, easy and compatible in fabricating flexible transistor arrays. It can be expected to fasten the pace in prototyping and manufacturing of flexible electronics.","authors":"Angela F. Harper; Peter J. Diemer; Oana D.

{"abstract":"USH2A encodes for usherin, a basement membrane protein in the inner ear and retina. USH2A can cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with or without hearing loss. The aim of this study was to detect USH2A mutations in a Chinese cohort of 75 small RP families and 10 Usher syndrome families. We performed a direct Sanger sequencing analysis of the USH2A gene to identify mutations for this cohort. We identified a total of eight mutations in four of the 75 small RP families (5.3%) and two mutations in one of the 10 Usher families (10%); all families were detected to have compound heterozygous mutations. In families with nonsyndromic RP, we identified the compound heterozygous mutations p.Pro4818Leuand p.Leu2395Hisfs*19 in family No. 19114, p.Arg4493His and p.His1677Glnfs*15 in family No.19162, c.8559-2A \u003e G and p.Arg1549* in family No.19123 and p.Ser5060Pro and p.Arg34Leufs*41 in family No.19178. We also identified the heterozygous mutations p.Arg3719His and p.Cys934Trp in family No.19124, which was the Usher syndrome family. These mutations were predicted to be harmful by SIFT, PROVEAN, Mutation Taster or PolyPhen-2. Our results revealed six novel mutations in the USH2A gene in a Chinese population, which is beneficial for the clinical use of genetic testing of USH2A in patients with autosomal-recessive or sporadic RP and Usher syndrome.","authors":"Lulin Huang; Yao Mao; Jiyun Yang; Yuanfeng Li; Yang Li; Zhenglin Yang","keywords":"Eye diseases; Retinal diseases","organization_affiliated":"Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and School of Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences \u0026 Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Institute of Chengdu Biology, and Sichuan Translational Medicine Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China; Center of Information in Biomedicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and School of Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences \u0026 Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and School of Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences \u0026 Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and School of Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences \u0026 Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study and the Department of Laboratory Medicine and School of Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences \u0026 Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Institute of Chengdu Biology, and Sichuan Translational Medicine Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China; Center of Information in Biomedicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","title":"Mutation screening of the USH2A gene in retinitis pigmentosa and USHER patients in a Han Chinese population","id":"ba458a7c-4dbe-4906-a38f-e3b677d5975b"}
{"abstract":"We live in a cluttered visual world that is overflowing with information, the continuous processing of which would be a truly daunting task. Nevertheless, our brains have evolved to select which part of a visual scene is to be prioritized and analysed in detail, and which parts can be discarded or analysed at a later stage. This selection is in part determined by the visual stimuli themselves, and is known as “selective attention”, which, in turn, determines how we explore and interact with our environment, including the distinct human artefacts produced in different socio-cultural contexts. Here we hypothesize that visual responses and material objects should therefore co-evolve to reflect changes in social complexity and culture throughout history. Using eye-tracking, we analysed the eye scan paths in response to prehistoric pottery ranging from the Neolithic through to the Iron Age (ca 6000–2000 BP), finding that each ceramic style caused a particular pattern of visual exploration. Horizontal movements become dominant in earlier periods, while vertical movements are more frequent in later periods that were marked by greater social complexity.","authors":"Felipe Criado-Boado; Diego Alonso-Pablos; Manuel J.

{"abstract":"Human (Hs) Roquin1 and Roquin2 are RNA-binding proteins that promote mRNA target degradation through the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and are implicated in the prevention of autoimmunity. Roquin1 recruits CCR4-NOT via a C-terminal region that is not conserved in Roquin2 or in invertebrate Roquin. Here we show that Roquin2 and Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) Roquin also interact with the CCR4-NOT complex through their C-terminal regions. The C-terminal region of Dm Roquin contains multiple motifs that mediate CCR4-NOT binding. One motif binds to the CAF40 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. The crystal structure of the Dm Roquin CAF40-binding motif (CBM) bound to CAF40 reveals that the CBM adopts an α-helical conformation upon binding to a conserved surface of CAF40. Thus, despite the lack of sequence conservation, the C-terminal regions of Roquin proteins act as an effector domain that represses the expression of mRNA targets via recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex. Roquin proteins downregulate target mRNA expression by recruiting effectors such as the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Here the authors provide molecular details of how Roquin proteins recruit the CCR4-NOT complex to repress the expression of its targets.","authors":"Annamaria Sgromo; Tobias Raisch; Praveen Bawankar; Dipankar Bhandari; Ying Chen; Duygu Kuzuoğlu-Öztürk; Oliver Weichenrieder; Elisa Izaurralde","keywords":"RNA; RNA decay; X-ray crystallography","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany","title":"A CAF40-binding motif facilitates recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex to mRNAs targeted by Drosophila Roquin","id":"2ba54e15-5082-4998-8ab0-e3598db42886"}
{"abstract":"A discrete-element based model of elastic-plastic materials with non-ideal plasticity and with an account of both cohesive and adhesive interactions inside the material is developed and verified. Based on this model, a detailed study of factors controlling the modes of adhesive wear is performed. Depending on the material and loading parameters, we observed three main modes of wear: slipping, plastic grinding, cleavage, and breakaway. We find that occurrence of a particular mode is determined by the combination of two dimensionless material parameters: (1) the ratio of the adhesive stress to the pure shear strength of the material, and (2) sensitivity parameter of material shear strength to local pressure. The case study map of asperity wear modes in the space of these parameters has been constructed. Results of this study further develop the findings of the widely discussed studies by the groups of J.-F. Molinari and L. Pastewka.","authors":"Andrey V. Dimaki; Evgeny V. Shilko; Ivan V.

Here we report on the origin of the asymmetrical transport characteristics caused by the degradation in the oxide semiconductor during integrated circuit driving. The variation of the current profiles based on test conditions is related to the generation of local defect states in the oxide material; this generation could be caused by the structural change of the material. The numerical calculations show that the flow of the electron is blocked by the “electrical pocket” formed by the electric-field distortion due to the local defect states near the edge of the electrode.","authors":"Hyeon-Jun Lee; Katsumi Abe; Jun Seo Kim; Myoung-Jae Lee","keywords":"Electrical and electronic engineering; Electronic devices","organization_affiliated":"Intelligent Devices \u0026 Systems Research Group, Institute of Convergence, DGIST, Daegu, Korea; Global Center for Bio-Convergence Spin System, DGIST, Daegu, Korea; Silvaco Japan Co., Ltd., Nakagyo-ku, Japan; Intelligent Devices \u0026 Systems Research Group, Institute of Convergence, DGIST, Daegu, Korea; Global Center for Bio-Convergence Spin System, DGIST, Daegu, Korea; Intelligent Devices \u0026 Systems Research Group, Institute of Convergence, DGIST, Daegu, Korea; Global Center for Bio-Convergence Spin System, DGIST, Daegu, Korea","title":"Electron-blocking by the potential barrier originated from the asymmetrical local density of state in the oxide semiconductor","id":"b2aa17b9-73a2-45ec-b436-d31114820e87"}
{"abstract":"The primary objective was to describe the early “natural history” of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the premature population. The secondary objective was to describe factors associated with poor outcomes in the premature population with PH at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Retrospective chart review of patients followed at our institution from 2000 to 2017 with echocardiographic (ECHO) evidence of PH at 36 weeks PMA, and born ≤ 32 weeks estimated gestational age (GA). Cox regression was used for survival analysis. Sixty-one patients with PH (26.5 ± 1.5 weeks at birth) were included. All PH patients had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), with 89% considered severe; 38% were small for gestational age. Necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery was common (25%). Use of post-natal steroids (HR 11.02, p = 0.01) and increased severity of PH (HR 1.05, p \u003c 0.001) were associated with mortality. Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) was documented in 26% of the PH cohort, but not associated with increased mortality. ECHO estimation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was available in 84%.

Most survivors (66%) had resolution of their PH on their most recent ECHO; 31% remained on PH therapy. PH resolved in most survivors in this study population. Mortality in those with BPD-PH was associated with male sex, post-natal steroid use, and increased severity of PH, but not with PVS.","authors":"Gabriel Altit; Shazia Bhombal; Rachel K.

{"abstract":"Insects feeding on the nutrient-poor diet of xylem plant sap generally bear two microbial symbionts that are localized to different organs (bacteriomes) and provide complementary sets of essential amino acids (EAAs). Here, we investigate the metabolic basis for the apparent paradox that xylem-feeding insects are under intense selection for metabolic efficiency but incur the cost of maintaining two symbionts for functions mediated by one symbiont in other associations. Using stable isotope analysis of central carbon metabolism and metabolic modeling, we provide evidence that the bacteriomes of the spittlebug Clastoptera proteus display high rates of aerobic glycolysis, with syntrophic splitting of glucose oxidation. Specifically, our data suggest that one bacteriome (containing the bacterium Sulcia, which synthesizes seven EAAs) predominantly processes glucose glycolytically, producing pyruvate and lactate, and the exported pyruvate and lactate is assimilated by the second bacteriome (containing the bacterium Zinderia, which synthesizes three energetically costly EAAs) and channeled through the TCA cycle for energy generation by oxidative phosphorylation. We, furthermore, calculate that this metabolic arrangement supports the high ATP demand in Zinderia bacteriomes for Zinderia-mediated synthesis of energy-intensive EAAs. We predict that metabolite cross-feeding among host cells may be widespread in animal–microbe symbioses utilizing low-nutrient diets.","authors":"Nana Y. D. Ankrah; Rebecca A. Wilkes; Freya Q.

{"abstract":"Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are widely used in clinical efficacy evaluation studies. Linear regression is a general method to evaluate treatment efficacy considering the existence of confounding variables. However, when residuals are not normally distributed, parameter estimation based on ordinary least squares (OLS) is inefficient. This study introduces an exponential squared loss (ESL) model to evaluate treatment effect. The proposed method provides robust estimation for non-normal data. Simulation results show that it outperforms ordinary least squares regression with contaminated data. In the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) efficacy evaluation study with traditional Chinese medicine, our method is applied to construct a linear efficacy evaluation model for the difference in Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) scores between the final and baseline records (ADASFA), with the existence of confounding factors and non- normal residuals. The results coincide with existing medical literatures. This proposed method overcomes the limitation of confounding variables and non-normal residuals in RCT efficacy studies. It outperforms OLS on estimation efficiency in situations where the percentage of non-normal contamination reaches 30%. These advantages make it a good method for real-world clinical studies.","authors":"Yang Li; Zhang Zhang; Qian Feng; Danhui Yi; Fang Lu","keywords":"Drug development; Epidemiology","organization_affiliated":"Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; School of Statistics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Statistical Consulting Center, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; School of Statistics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Statistical Consulting Center, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; School of Statistics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Statistical Consulting Center, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China","title":"An efficacy evaluation method for non-normal outcomes in randomized controlled trials","id":"11bd1958-621b-441c-8033-e6268348bd25"}
{"abstract":"Advances in large-scale analysis are becoming very useful in understanding health and disease. Here, we used high-throughput mass spectrometry to identify differentially expressed proteins between early and advanced lesions. Carotid endarterectomy samples were collected and dissected into early and advanced atherosclerotic lesion portions. Proteins were extracted and subjected to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified and verified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), on which advanced systems biology and enrichment analyses were performed. The identified proteins were further compared to the transcriptomic data of 32 paired samples obtained from early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. A total of 95 proteins were upregulated, and 117 proteins were downregulated in advanced lesions compared to early atherosclerotic lesions (p \u003c 0.05). The upregulated proteins were associated with proatherogenic processes, whereas downregulated proteins were involved in extracellular matrix organization and vascular smooth muscle cytoskeleton. Many of the identified proteins were linked to various “upstream regulators”, among which TGFβ had the highest connections. Specifically, a total of 19 genes were commonly upregulated, and 30 genes were downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. These genes were involved in vascular smooth muscle cell activity, for which enriched transcription factors were identified. This study deciphers altered pathways in atherosclerosis and identifies upstream regulators that could be candidate targets for treatment.","authors":"Ali Nehme; Firas Kobeissy; Jingfu Zhao; Rui Zhu; Patrick Feugier; Yehia Mechref; Kazem Zibara","keywords":"Medicine/Public Health, general; Internal Medicine; Public Health; Geriatrics/Gerontology; Obstetrics/Perinatology/Midwifery; Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","organization_affiliated":"EA4173, Functional genomics of arterial hypertension, UCBL-1, Villeurbanne, France; PRASE, DSST, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, USA; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, USA; Service de Chirurgie Vasculaire, Hôpital Universitaire E Herriot, Lyon, France; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, USA; PRASE, DSST, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon","title":"Functional pathways associated with human carotid atheroma: a proteomics analysis","id":"de842614-6112-4ea0-90b5-5294cc5432b0"}
{"abstract":"Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) is responsible for the production of PGD2 in adipocytes and is selectively induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in adipose tissue. In this study, we investigated the effects of HFD on obesity and insulin resistance in two distinct types of adipose-specific L-PGDS gene knockout (KO) mice: fatty acid binding protein 4 (fabp4, aP2)-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox and adiponectin (AdipoQ)-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. The L-PGDS gene was deleted in adipocytes in the premature stage of the former strain and after maturation of the latter strain. The L-PGDS expression and PGD2 production levels decreased in white adipose tissue (WAT) under HFD conditions only in the aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, but were unchanged in the AdipoQ-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. When fed an HFD, aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice significantly reduced body weight gain, adipocyte size, and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In WAT of the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice, the expression levels of the adipogenic, lipogenic, and M1 macrophage marker genes were decreased, whereas those of the lipolytic and M2 macrophage marker genes were enhanced or unchanged. Insulin sensitivity was improved in the HFD-fed aP2-Cre/L-PGDS flox/flox mice. These results indicate that PGD2 produced by L-PGDS in premature adipocytes is involved in the regulation of body weight gain and insulin resistance under nutrient-dense conditions.","authors":"Ko Fujimori; Kosuke Aritake; Yo Oishi; Nanae Nagata; Toko Maehara; Michael Lazarus; Yoshihiro Urade","keywords":"Lipid peroxides; Obesity","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pathobiochemistry, Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Takatsuki, Japan; Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, Daiichi University of Pharmacy, Minami-ku, Japan; International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Animal Radiology and Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Department of Pathobiochemistry, Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Takatsuki, Japan; International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; The University of Tokyo Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Japan; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Japan","title":"L-PGDS-produced PGD 2 in premature, but not in mature, adipocytes increases obesity and insulin resistance","id":"32a44e12-cb78-4868-857c-2066ea89a36a"}
{"abstract":"Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced intestinal damage is characterized by a loss of intestinal crypt cells, intestinal barrier disruption and translocation of intestinal microflora resulting in sepsis-mediated lethality. We have shown that mice lacking C/EBPδ display IR-induced intestinal and hematopoietic injury and lethality. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether increased IR-induced inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress promote intestinal injury and sepsis-mediated lethality in Cebpd−/− mice. We found that irradiated Cebpd−/− mice show decreased villous height, crypt depth, crypt to villi ratio and expression of the proliferation marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, indicative of intestinal injury. Cebpd−/− mice show increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-6, Tnf-α) and chemokines (Cxcl1, Mcp-1, Mif-1α) and Nos2 in the intestinal tissues compared to Cebpd+/+ mice after exposure to TBI. Cebpd−/− mice show decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, increased S-nitrosoglutathione and 3-nitrotyrosine in the intestine indicative of basal oxidative and nitrosative stress, which was exacerbated by IR. Irradiated Cebpd-deficient mice showed upregulation of Claudin-2 that correlated with increased intestinal permeability, presence of plasma endotoxin and bacterial translocation to the liver. Overall these results uncover a novel role for C/EBPδ in protection against IR-induced intestinal injury by suppressing inflammation and nitrosative stress and underlying sepsis-induced lethality.","authors":"Sudip Banerjee; Qiang Fu; Sumit K.

{"abstract":"Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is an under-utilized Level A evidence-based treatment for migraine prevention. We studied the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA diary and do PMR for 20 min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR (no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% female). Mean age was 39 ± 13 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22 ± 21 days on average. Mean/session duration was 11 ± 7 min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR \u003c 2 days/week in the first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no activity) in a week (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at least once in a week (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = [1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week (OR = 1.14 [95% CI = [1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days.

{"abstract":"Dynamic self-organisation far from equilibrium is a key concept towards building autonomously acting materials. Here, we report the coupling of an antagonistic enzymatic reaction of RNA polymerisation and degradation to the aggregation of micron sized DNA coated colloids into fractal structures. A transient colloidal aggregation process is controlled by competing reactions of RNA synthesis of linker strands by a RNA polymerase and their degradation by a ribonuclease. By limiting the energy supply (NTP) of the enzymatic reactions, colloidal clusters form and subsequently disintegrate without the need of external stimuli. Here, the autonomous colloidal aggregation and disintegration can be modulated in terms of lifetime and cluster size. By restricting the enzyme activity locally, a directed spatial propagation of a colloidal aggregation and disintegration front is realised.","authors":"H. Dehne; A. Reitenbach; A. R.

{"abstract":"Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries are receiving intense interest as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, however, the absence of high-performance anode materials limits their further commercialization. Here we prepare cobalt-doped tin disulfide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach. These nanocomposites maintain a capacity of 636.2 mAh g−1 after 120 cycles under a current density of 50 mA g−1, and display a capacity of 328.3 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles under a current density of 2 A g−1. The quantitative capacitive analysis demonstrates that the electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite originates from the combined effects of cobalt and sulfur doping, resulting in the enhanced pseudocapacitive contribution (52.8 to 89.8% at 1 mV s−1) of tin disulfide. This work provides insight into tuning the structure of layered transition metal dichalcogenides via heteroatom doping to develop high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Rechargeable sodium ion batteries are a promising alternative to lithium technologies, however there are fewer high-performing anode materials. Here, the authors prepare a cobalt-doped tin disulfide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite and demonstrate its enhanced sodium kinetics and improved rate performance.","authors":"Hao Jia; Chen Chen; Olabode Oladele; Yongan Tang; Guoqing Li; Xiangwu Zhang; Fei Yan","keywords":"Batteries; Energy; Synthesis and processing","organization_affiliated":"Department of Textile Engineering, Chemistry and Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA; Department of Mathematics and Physics, North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA; Department of Mathematics and Physics, North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA; Department of Textile Engineering, Chemistry and Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA","title":"Cobalt doping of tin disulfide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for enhanced pseudocapacitive sodium-ion storage","id":"1366b461-48ed-4610-9e62-e58e21b2cf48"}
{"abstract":"The storage of metastable compounds and modifications of elements are of great interest for synthesis and other, e.g., semiconductor, applications. Whereas white phosphorus is a metastable modification that can be stored under certain conditions, storage of the extremely (light- and air-)sensitive form of arsenic, yellow arsenic, is a challenge rarely tackled so far. Herein, we report on the facile storage and release of these tetrahedral E4 molecules (E = P, As) using activated carbon as a porous storage material. These loaded materials are air- and light-stable and have been comprehensively characterized by solid-state 31P{1H} MAS NMR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, nitrogen adsorption measurements, and thermogravimetric analysis. Additionally, we show that these materials can be used as a suitable E4 source for releasing intact white phosphorus or yellow arsenic, enabling subsequent reactions in solution. Because the uptake and release of E4 are reversible, these materials are excellent carriers of these highly reactive modifications. White phosphorus and yellow arsenic represent useful elemental sources for synthetic applications, but their poor stabilities make their storage highly challenging. Here, Scheer and colleagues encapsulate P4 and As4 molecules within porous activated carbons and demonstrate their use in subsequent chemical reactions.","authors":"Andreas E.

{"abstract":"Structural variation (SV) is associated with inherited diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an efficient method for SV detection because of its high-throughput, low cost, and base-pair resolution. However, due to lack of standard NGS protocols and a limited number of clinical samples with pathogenic SVs, comprehensive standards for SV detection, interpretation, and reporting are to be established. We performed SV assessment on 60,000 clinical samples tested with hereditary cancer NGS panels spanning 48 genes. To evaluate NGS results, NGS and orthogonal methods were used separately in a blinded fashion for SV detection in all samples. A total of 1,037 SVs in coding sequence (CDS) or untranslated regions (UTRs) and 30,847 SVs in introns were detected and validated. Across all variant types, NGS shows 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity. Overall, 64% of CDS/UTR SVs were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, and five deletions/duplications were reclassified as pathogenic using breakpoint information from NGS. The SVs presented here can be used as a valuable resource for clinical research and diagnostics. The data illustrate NGS as a powerful tool for SV detection. Application of NGS and confirmation technologies in genetic testing ensures delivering accurate and reliable results for diagnosis and patient care.","authors":"Wenbo Mu; Bing Li; Sitao Wu; Jefferey Chen; Divya Sain; Dong Xu; Mary Helen Black; Rachid Karam; Katrina Gillespie; Kelly D.

{"abstract":"To achieve the US Department of Energy 2018 target set for platinum-group metal-free catalysts (PGM-free catalysts) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the low density of active sites must be overcome. Here, we report a class of concave Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts possessing an enhanced external surface area and mesoporosity that meets the 2018 PGM-free catalyst activity target, and a current density of 0.047 A cm–2 at 0.88 ViR-free under 1.0 bar H2–O2. This performance stems from the high density of active sites, which is realized through exposing inaccessible Fe–N4 moieties (that is, increasing their utilization) and enhancing the mass transport of the catalyst layer. Further, we establish structure–property correlations that provide a route for designing highly efficient PGM-free catalysts for practical application, achieving a power density of 1.18 W cm−2 under 2.5 bar H2–O2, and an activity of 129 mA cm−2 at 0.8 ViR-free under 1.0 bar H2–air. Iron single-atom catalysts are among the most promising fuel cell cathode materials in acid electrolyte solution. Now, Shui, Xu and co-workers report concave-shaped Fe–N–C nanoparticles with increased availability of active sites and improved mass transport, meeting the US Department of Energy 2018 target for platinum-group metal-free fuel cell catalysts.

{"abstract":"Molecular techniques are not routinely employed for malaria surveillance, while cross-sectional, community-based parasite surveys require significant resources. Here, we describe a novel use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) collected at a single facility as source material for sequencing to esimtate malaria transmission intensity across a relatively large catchment area. We extracted Plasmodium falciparum DNA from RDTs, then amplified and sequenced a region of the apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) using targeted amplicon deep sequencing. We determined the multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each sample and examined associations with demographic, clinical, and spatial factors. We successfully genotyped 223 of 287 (77.7%) of the samples. We demonstrated an inverse relationship between the MOI and elevation with individuals presenting from the highest elevation villages harboring infections approximately half as complex as those from the lowest (MOI 1.85 vs. 3.51, AOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09–0.65, p = 0.004). This study demonstrates the feasibility and validity of using routinely-collected RDTs for molecular surveillance of malaria and has real-world utility, especially as the cost of high-throughpout sequencing continues to decline.","authors":"Ross M.

{"abstract":"Vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs), expressed in most mesenchymal and cancer cells, undergo dramatic reorganization during cell migration; however, the mechanism remains obscure. This study demonstrates that upon growth-factor stimulation, Src directly phosphorylates vimentin at Tyr117, leading to VIF disassembly into squiggles and particles at the cell edge during lamellipodia formation. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 counteracted the Src effects on VIF tyrosine phosphorylation and organization. VIFs formed by vimentin Y117D mutant were more soluble and dynamic than those formed by the wild-type and Y117F mutant. Increased expression of vimentin promoted growth-factor induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration, whereas the mutants suppressed both. The vimentin-induced increase in lamellipodia formation correlated with the activation of Rac and Vav2, with the latter associated with VIFs and recruited to the plasma membrane upon growth-factor stimulation. These results reveal a novel mechanism for regulating VIF dynamics through Src and SHP2 and demonstrate that proper VIF dynamics are important for Rac activation and cell migration.","authors":"Cheng-Yi Yang; Po-Wei Chang; Wen-Hsin Hsu; Hsuan-Chia Chang; Chien-Lin Chen; Chien-Chen Lai; Wen-Tai Chiu; Hong-Chen Chen","keywords":"Intermediate filaments; Phosphorylation","organization_affiliated":"Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Cancer Progression Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Cancer Progression Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Src and SHP2 coordinately regulate the dynamics and organization of vimentin filaments during cell migration","id":"522bfc53-194e-4000-a35c-e5af30f0c916"}

{"abstract":"Omniphobic membranes are attractive for membrane distillation (MD) because of their superior wetting resistance. However, a design framework for MD membrane remains incomplete, due to the complexity of omniphobic membrane fabrication and the lack of fundamental relationship between wetting resistance and water vapor permeability. Here we present a particle-free approach that enables rapid fabrication of monolithic omniphobic membranes for MD desalination. Our monolithic omniphobic membranes display excellent wetting resistance and water purification performance in MD desalination of hypersaline feedwater containing surfactants. We identify that a trade-off exists between wetting resistance and water vapor permeability of our monolithic MD membranes. Utilizing membranes with tunable wetting resistance and permeability, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of such trade-off. We envision that our fabrication method as well as the mechanistic insight into the wetting resistance-vapor permeability trade-off will pave the way for smart design of MD membranes in diverse water purification applications.

{"abstract":"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is accurate for fetal sex determination in singleton pregnancies, but its accuracy is not well established in twin pregnancies. Here, we present an accurate sex prediction model to discriminate fetal sex in both dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) and monochorionic diamniotic/monochorionic monoamniotic (MCDA/MCMA) twin pregnancies. A retrospective analysis was performed using a total of 198 twin pregnancies with documented sex. The prediction was based on a multinomial logistic regression using the normalized frequency of X and Y chromosomes, and fetal fraction estimation. A second-step regression analysis was applied when one or both twins were predicted to be male. The model determines fetal sex with 100% sensitivity and specificity when both twins are female, and with 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity when a male is present. Since sex determination can be clinically important, implementing fetal sex determination in twins will improve overall twin pregnancies management.","authors":"Darine Villela; Huiwen Che; Marijke Van Ghelue; Luc Dehaspe; Nathalie Brison; Kris Van Den Bogaert; Koen Devriendt; Liesbeth Lewi; Baran Bayindir; Joris Robert Vermeesch","keywords":"Genetics research; Medical genetics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Biosciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Medical Genetics, Division of Child and Adolescent Health, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Tromsø, Tromsø, Norway; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Clinical Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Development and Regeneration, Cluster Woman and Child, Group Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","title":"Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing","id":"dfebf341-6308-448b-8d04-5943fa7ff58b"}

{"abstract":"Crystal structures of HIV Env trimer with native glycosylation in complex with neutralizing antibodies reveal a glycan shield of high-mannose and complex-type N-glycan and indicate a path for germline-targeting vaccine design. HIV-1 vaccine design is informed by structural studies elucidating mechanisms by which broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize and/or accommodate N-glycans on the trimeric envelope glycoprotein (Env). Variability in high-mannose and complex-type Env glycoforms leads to heterogeneity that usually precludes visualization of the native glycan shield. We present 3.5-Å- and 3.9-Å-resolution crystal structures of the HIV-1 Env trimer with fully processed and native glycosylation, revealing a glycan shield of high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans, which we used to define complete epitopes of two bNAbs. Env trimer was complexed with 10-1074 (against the V3-loop) and IOMA, a new CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibody. Although IOMA derives from VH1-2*02, the germline gene of CD4bs-targeting VRC01-class bNAbs, its light chain lacks the short CDRL3 that defines VRC01-class bNAbs. Thus IOMA resembles 8ANC131-class/VH1-46–derived CD4bs bNAbs, which have normal-length CDRL3s. The existence of bNAbs that combine features of VRC01-class and 8ANC131-class antibodies has implications for immunization strategies targeting VRC01-like bNAbs.","authors":"Harry B Gristick; Lotta von Boehmer; Anthony P West Jr; Michael Schamber; Anna Gazumyan; Jovana Golijanin; Michael S Seaman; Gerd Fätkenheuer; Florian Klein; Michel C Nussenzweig; Pamela J Bjorkman","keywords":"Glycoproteins; Immunology; X-ray crystallography","organization_affiliated":"Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA; Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA","title":"Natively glycosylated HIV-1 Env structure reveals new mode for antibody recognition of the CD4-binding site","id":"3e48dfba-1faa-4ae8-96df-8ab73b12890d"}
{"abstract":"Restricted intermittent food access to palatable food (PF) induces addiction-like behaviors and plastic changes in corticolimbic brain areas. Intermittent access protocols normally schedule PF to a fixed time, enabling animals to predict the arrival of PF. Because outside the laboratory the presence of PF may occur in a random unpredictable manner, the present study explored whether random access to PF would stimulate similar addiction-like responses as observed under a fixed scheduled. Rats were randomly assigned to a control group without chocolate access, to ad libitum access to chocolate, to fixed intermittent access (CH-F), or to random unpredictable access (CH-R) to chocolate. Only the CH-F group developed behavioral and core temperature anticipation to PF access. Both groups exposed to intermittent access to PF showed binge eating, increased effort behaviors to obtain chocolate, as well as high FosB/ΔFosB in corticolimbic areas. Moreover, FosB/ΔFosB in all areas correlated with the intensity of binge eating and effort behaviors. We conclude that both conditions of intermittent access to PF stimulate addiction-like behaviors and FosB/ΔFosB accumulation in brain reward areas; while only a fixed schedule, which provides a time clue, elicited anticipatory activation, which is strongly associated with craving behaviors and may favor relapse during withdrawal.","authors":"Geovanni Muñoz-Escobar; Natalí N.

{"abstract":"We compared different methods of multi-scale terrain feature construction and their relative effectiveness for digital soil mapping with a Deep Learning algorithm. The most common approach for multi-scale feature construction in DSM is to filter terrain attributes based on different neighborhood sizes, however results can be difficult to interpret because the approach is affected by outliers. Alternatively, one can derive the terrain attributes on decomposed elevation data, but the resulting maps can have artefacts rendering the approach undesirable. Here, we introduce ‘mixed scaling’ a new method that overcomes these issues and preserves the landscape features that are identifiable at different scales. The new method also extends the Gaussian pyramid by introducing additional intermediate scales. This minimizes the risk that the scales that are important for soil formation are not available in the model. In our extended implementation of the Gaussian pyramid, we tested four intermediate scales between any two consecutive octaves of the Gaussian pyramid and modelled the data with Deep Learning and Random Forests. We performed the experiments using three different datasets and show that mixed scaling with the extended Gaussian pyramid produced the best performing set of covariates and that modelling with Deep Learning produced the most accurate predictions, which on average were 4–7% more accurate compared to modelling with Random Forests.","authors":"Thorsten Behrens; Karsten Schmidt; Robert A.

In the RNAseq analysis, TIGIT expression was significantly increased in IM-PD/SU-treated GISTs compared to IM-PD (p = 0.01). Immunosuppressive phenotype was predominant in tumours treated with anti-angiogenic agents compared to TKI-naive and IM-treated tumours.","authors":"Changhoon Yoo; Yeon-mi Ryu; Sang-Yeob Kim; Jihun Kim; Chan Young Ock; Min-Hee Ryu; Yoon-Koo Kang","keywords":"Cancer microenvironment; Sarcoma","organization_affiliated":"Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Theragen Etex Bio Institute, Suwon, Korea; Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea","title":"Association between the exposure to anti-angiogenic agents and tumour immune microenvironment in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours","id":"541712b2-08d2-4ca5-a6b7-42eb274a37ec"}
{"abstract":"Certain methanogens deteriorate steel surfaces through a process called microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). However, the mechanisms of MIC, whereby methanogens oxidize zerovalent iron (Fe0), are largely unknown. In this study, Fe0-corroding Methanococcus maripaludis strain OS7 and its derivative (strain OS7mut1) defective in Fe0-corroding activity were isolated. Genomic analysis of these strains demonstrated that the strain OS7mut1 contained a 12-kb chromosomal deletion. The deleted region, termed “MIC island”, encoded the genes for the large and small subunits of a [NiFe] hydrogenase, the TatA/TatC genes necessary for the secretion of the [NiFe] hydrogenase, and a gene for the hydrogenase maturation protease. Thus, the [NiFe] hydrogenase may be secreted outside the cytoplasmic membrane, where the [NiFe] hydrogenase can make direct contact with Fe0, and oxidize it, generating hydrogen gas: Fe0 + 2 H+ → Fe2+ + H2. Comparative analysis of extracellular and intracellular proteomes of strain OS7 supported this hypothesis. The identification of the MIC genes enables the development of molecular tools to monitor epidemiology, and to perform surveillance and risk assessment of MIC-inducing M. maripaludis.","authors":"Hirohito Tsurumaru; Naofumi Ito; Koji Mori; Satoshi Wakai; Taku Uchiyama; Takao Iino; Akira Hosoyama; Hanako Ataku; Keiko Nishijima; Miyako Mise; Ai Shimizu; Takeshi Harada; Hiroshi Horikawa; Natsuko Ichikawa; Tomohiro Sekigawa; Koji Jinno; Satoshi Tanikawa; Jun Yamazaki; Kazumi Sasaki; Syuji Yamazaki; Nobuyuki Fujita; Shigeaki Harayama","keywords":"Archaeal genomics; Environmental biotechnology","organization_affiliated":"NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Chiba, Japan","title":"An extracellular [NiFe] hydrogenase mediating iron corrosion is encoded in a genetically unstable genomic island in Methanococcus maripaludis","id":"1d64598f-fc0e-42cc-a500-308da32e4f8a"}
{"abstract":"The critical mutation rate (CMR) determines the shift between survival-of-the-fittest and survival of individuals with greater mutational robustness (“flattest”). We identify an inverse relationship between CMR and sequence length in an in silico system with a two-peak fitness landscape; CMR decreases to no more than five orders of magnitude above estimates of eukaryotic per base mutation rate. We confirm the CMR reduces exponentially at low population sizes, irrespective of peak radius and distance, and increases with the number of genetic crossovers. We also identify an inverse relationship between CMR and the number of genes, confirming that, for a similar number of genes to that for the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (25,000), the CMR is close to its known wild-type mutation rate; mutation rates for additional organisms were also found to be within one order of magnitude of the CMR. This is the first time such a simulation model has been assigned input and produced output within range for a given biological organism. The decrease in CMR with population size previously observed is maintained; there is potential for the model to influence understanding of populations undergoing bottleneck, stress, and conservation strategy for populations near extinction.","authors":"Elizabeth Aston; Alastair Channon; Roman V.

{"abstract":"The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has been associated with sensitivity to stress and affective disorders. We therefore sought to model the inter-causality of these relationships under controlled laboratory conditions. We subjected humanized BDNF Val66Met (hBDNFVal66Met) transgenic mice to a history of stress, modeled by chronic late-adolescent corticosterone (CORT) exposure, before evaluating affective-related behavior using the forced-swim test (FST) in adulthood. While hBDNFMet/Met mice had a depression-like phenotype in the FST irrespective of CORT, hBDNFVal/Val wildtype mice had a resilient phenotype but developed an equally robust depressive-like phenotype following CORT. A range of stress-sensitive molecules were studied across the corticohippocampal axis, and where genotype differences occurred following CORT they tended to inversely coincide with the behavior of the hBDNFVal/Val group. Notably, tyrosine hydroxylase was markedly down-regulated in the mPFC of hBDNFVal/Val mice as a result of CORT treatment, which mimicked expression levels of hBDNFMet/Met mice and the FST behavior of both groups. The expression of calretinin, PSD-95, and truncated TrkB were also concomitantly reduced in the mPFC of hBDNFVal/Val mice by CORT. This work establishes BDNFVal66Met genotype as a regulator of behavioral despair, and identifies new biological targets of BDNF genetic variation relevant to stress-inducible disorders such as depression.","authors":"M Notaras; X Du; J Gogos; M van den Buuse; R A Hill","keywords":"Depression; Molecular neuroscience","organization_affiliated":"Behavioural Neuroscience Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; Psychoneuroendocrinology Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; Center for Neurogenetics, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, USA; Psychoneuroendocrinology Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; Departments of Biophysics \u0026 Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, USA; Behavioural Neuroscience Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Pharmacology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia; Behavioural Neuroscience Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; Psychoneuroendocrinology Laboratory, Florey Institute of Neuroscience \u0026 Mental Health, Parkville, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","title":"The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism regulates glucocorticoid-induced corticohippocampal remodeling and behavioral despair","id":"4093ff4d-3fe7-4af5-a911-dda3e5430114"}
{"abstract":"Rapamycin (Sirolimus) slows aging, extends life span, and prevents age-related diseases, including diabetic complications such as retinopathy. Puzzlingly, rapamycin can induce insulin sensitivity, but may also induce insulin resistance or glucose intolerance without insulin resistance. This mirrors the effect of fasting and very low calorie diets, which improve insulin sensitivity and reverse type 2 diabetes, but also can cause a form of glucose intolerance known as benevolent pseudo-diabetes. There is no indication that starvation (benevolent) pseudo-diabetes is detrimental. By contrast, it is associated with better health and life extension. In transplant patients, a weak association between rapamycin/everolimus use and hyperglycemia is mostly due to a drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. When it occurs in cancer patients, the hyperglycemia is mild and reversible. No hyperglycemic effects of rapamycin/everolimus have been detected in healthy people. For antiaging purposes, rapamycin/everolimus can be administrated intermittently (e.g., once a week) in combination with intermittent carbohydrate restriction, physical exercise, and metformin.","authors":"Mikhail V.

{"abstract":"Placental malaria has been associated with an immune tolerance phenomenon and a higher susceptibility to malaria infection during infancy. HLA-G is involved in fetal maternal immune tolerance by inhibiting maternal immunity. During infections HLA-G can be involved in immune escape of pathogens by creating a tolerogenic environment. Recent studies have shown an association between the risk of malaria and HLA-G at both genetic and protein levels. Moreover, women with placental malaria have a higher probability of giving birth to children exhibiting high sHLA-G, independently of their own level during pregnancy. Our aim was to explore the association between the level of maternal soluble HLA-G and the risk of malaria infection in their newborns. Here, 400 pregnant women and their children were actively followed-up during 24 months. The results show a significant association between the level of sHLA-G at the first antenatal visit and the time to first malaria infection during infancy adjusted to the risk of exposure to vector bites (aHR = 1.02, 95%CI [1.01–1.03], p = 0.014). The level of sHLA-G is a significant predictor of the occurrence of malaria infection during infancy consistent with the hypothesis that mother sHLA-G could be a biomarker of malaria susceptibility in children.","authors":"Tania C. d’Almeida; Ibrahim Sadissou; Mermoz Sagbohan; Jacqueline Milet; Euripide Avokpaho; Laure Gineau; Audrey Sabbagh; Kabirou Moutairou; Eduardo A.

{"abstract":"Single-atom metal catalysts offer a promising way to utilize precious noble metal elements more effectively, provided that they are catalytically active and sufficiently stable. Herein, we report a synthetic strategy for Pt single-atom catalysts with outstanding stability in several reactions under demanding conditions. The Pt atoms are firmly anchored in the internal surface of mesoporous Al2O3, likely stabilized by coordinatively unsaturated pentahedral Al3+ centres. The catalyst keeps its structural integrity and excellent performance for the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene after exposure to a reductive atmosphere at 200 °C for 24 h. Compared to commercial Pt nanoparticle catalyst on Al2O3 and control samples, this system exhibits significantly enhanced stability and performance for n-hexane hydro-reforming at 550 °C for 48 h, although agglomeration of Pt single-atoms into clusters is observed after reaction. In CO oxidation, the Pt single-atom identity was fully maintained after 60 cycles between 100 and 400 °C over a one-month period. Using precious noble elements as single atom metal catalysts is highly desirable and effective. Here the authors show the use of platinum atom catalysts anchored in mesoporous Al2O3for selective hydrogenation and CO oxidation that have better stability and performance compared to their nanoparticle counterparts.","authors":"Zailei Zhang; Yihan Zhu; Hiroyuki Asakura; Bin Zhang; Jiaguang Zhang; Maoxiang Zhou; Yu Han; Tsunehiro Tanaka; Aiqin Wang; Tao Zhang; Ning Yan","keywords":"Heterogeneous catalysis; Sustainability","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, Advanced Membranes and Porous Materials Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Molecular Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts \u0026 Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, Advanced Membranes and Porous Materials Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, KAUST Catalysis Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Molecular Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts \u0026 Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","title":"Thermally stable single atom Pt/m-Al 2 O 3 for selective hydrogenation and CO oxidation","id":"e1c1fbae-b834-4335-ba1f-bec342f4ff63"}
{"abstract":"Estimating total narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations remains an open question. In this work, we used extensive simulations to evaluate existing linear mixed-model frameworks for estimating total narrow-sense heritability in two population-based cohorts from Greenland, and compared the results with data from unadmixed individuals from Denmark. When our analysis focused on Greenlandic sib pairs, and under the assumption that shared environment among siblings has a negligible effect, the model with two relationship matrices, one capturing identity by descent and one capturing identity by state, returned heritability estimates close to the true simulated value, while using each of the two matrices alone led to downward biases. When phenotypes correlated with ancestry, heritability estimates were inflated. Based on these observations, we propose a PCA-based adjustment that recovers the true simulated heritability. We use this knowledge to estimate the heritability of ten quantitative traits from the two Greenlandic cohorts, and report differences such as lower heritability for height in Greenlanders compared with Europeans. In conclusion, narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations is best estimated when using a mixture of genetic relationship matrices on individuals with at least one first-degree relative included in the sample.","authors":"Georgios Athanasiadis; Doug Speed; Mette K.

This clearly creates multiple opportunities for their potential application, but it also creates the following challenge: how does one identify the most promising structures, among the thousands of possibilities, for a particular application? Here, we present a case of computer-aided material discovery, in which we complete the full cycle from computational screening of metal–organic framework materials for oxygen storage, to identification, synthesis and measurement of oxygen adsorption in the top-ranked structure. We introduce an interactive visualization concept to analyze over 1000 unique structure–property plots in five dimensions and delimit the relationships between structural properties and oxygen adsorption performance at different pressures for 2932 already-synthesized structures. We also report a world-record holding material for oxygen storage, UMCM-152, which delivers 22.5% more oxygen than the best known material to date, to the best of our knowledge. The emergence of thousands of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has created the challenge of finding promising structures for particular applications.

{"abstract":"Modern decision neuroscience offers a powerful and broad account of human behaviour using computational techniques that link psychological and neuroscientific approaches to the ways that individuals can generate near-optimal choices in complex controlled environments. However, until recently, relatively little attention has been paid to the extent to which the structure of experimental environments relates to natural scenarios, and the survival problems that individuals have evolved to solve. This situation not only risks leaving decision-theoretic accounts ungrounded but also makes various aspects of the solutions, such as hard-wired or Pavlovian policies, difficult to interpret in the natural world. Here, we suggest importing concepts, paradigms and approaches from the fields of ethology and behavioural ecology, which concentrate on the contextual and functional correlates of decisions made about foraging and escape and address these lacunae. In this Opinion article, Mobbs and colleagues argue that more should be done to combine the approaches taken in neuroscience with those taken in ethology and behavioural ecology to study decision-making. They illustrate how this has been achieved in the context of studies on foraging.","authors":"Dean Mobbs; Pete C. Trimmer; Daniel T.

{"abstract":"Cancer cells are commonly more resistant to cell death activated by the membranolytic protein complex C5b-9. Several surface-expressed and intracellular proteins that protect cells from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) have been identified. In this study, we investigated the function of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an essential and ubiquitously expressed chaperone, overexpressed in cancer cells, in C5b-9-induced cell death. As shown, inhibition of Hsp90 with geldanamycin or radicicol is enhancing sensitivity of K562 erythroleukemia cells to CDC. Similarly, Hsp90 inhibition confers in Ramos B cell lymphoma cells elevated sensitivity to treatment with rituximab and complement. C5b-9 deposition is elevated on geldanamycin-treated cells. Purified Hsp90 binds directly to C9 and inhibits zinc-induced C9 polymerization, indicating that Hsp90 may act directly on the C5b-9 complex. Mortalin, also known as stress protein 70 or GRP75, is a mitochondrial chaperone that confers resistance to CDC. The postulated cooperation between Hsp90 and mortalin in protection from CDC was tested. Geldanamycin failed to sensitize toward CDC cells with knocked down mortalin. Direct binding of Hsp90 to mortalin was shown by co-immunoprecipitation in cell extracts after triggering with complement as well as by using purified recombinant proteins. These results provide an insight into the protective mechanisms utilized by cancer cells to evade CDC. They suggest that Hsp90 protects cells from CDC by inhibiting, together with mortalin, C5b-9 assembly and/or stability at the plasma membrane.","authors":"Perri Rozenberg; Lea Ziporen; Dana Gancz; Moran Saar-Ray; Zvi Fishelson","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel","title":"Cooperation between Hsp90 and mortalin/GRP75 in resistance to cell death induced by complement C5b-9","id":"da553568-0288-4def-a66f-ed0a297b4186"}
{"abstract":"The elimination of DNA polymerase eta (pol η) causes discontinuous DNA elongation and fork stalling in UV-irradiated cells. Such alterations in DNA replication are followed by S-phase arrest, DNA double-strand break (DSB) accumulation, and cell death. However, their molecular triggers and the relative timing of these events have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that DSBs accumulate relatively early after UV irradiation in pol η-depleted cells. Despite the availability of repair pathways, DSBs persist and chromosome instability (CIN) is not detectable. Later on cells with pan-nuclear γH2AX and massive exposure of template single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which indicate severe replication stress, accumulate and such events are followed by cell death. Reinforcing the causal link between the accumulation of pan-nuclear ssDNA/γH2AX signals and cell death, downregulation of RPA increased both replication stress and the cell death of pol η-deficient cells. Remarkably, DSBs, pan-nuclear ssDNA/γH2AX, S-phase arrest, and cell death are all attenuated by MRE11 nuclease knockdown. Such results suggest that unscheduled MRE11-dependent activities at replicating DNA selectively trigger cell death, but not CIN. Together these results show that pol η-depletion promotes a type of cell death that may be attractive as a therapeutic tool because of the lack of CIN.","authors":"María Belén Federico; Sebastián Omar Siri; Nicolás Luis Calzetta; Natalia Soledad Paviolo; María Belén de la Vega; Julieta Martino; María Carolina Campana; Lisa Wiesmüller; Vanesa Gottifredi","keywords":"Cancer genetics; Mechanisms of disease","organization_affiliated":"Cell Cycle and Genomic Stability laboratory.

{"abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and fine-mapping efforts to date have identified more than 100 prostate cancer (PrCa)-susceptibility loci. We meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62 novel loci associated (P \u003c 5.0 × 10−8) with PrCa and one locus significantly associated with early-onset PrCa (≤55 years). Our findings include missense variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 8.2 × 10−9; G\u003eC, p.Pro1054Arg) in ATM and rs2066827 (OR = 1.06; P = 2.3 × 10−9; T\u003eG, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B. The combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial relative risk, and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated PrCa risk for men in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles (relative risk = 2.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.55–2.82) and first percentile (relative risk = 5.71; 95% CI: 5.04–6.48) risk stratum compared with the population average. These findings improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and provide insight into the underlying biology of PrCa1. A large meta-analysis combining genome-wide and custom high-density genotyping array data identifies 63 new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer, enhancing fine-mapping efforts and providing insights into the underlying biology.","authors":"Fredrick R.

{"abstract":"Transcriptional deregulation has a vital role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Thus, identification of epigenetic modifiers essential for oncogenic transcriptional programs is a key to designing effective therapeutics for this deadly disease. Here we report that Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) is highly expressed in GBM and correlated with poor prognosis. The silencing or inactivation of PRMT2 inhibits GBM cell growth and glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal in vitro, and suppresses orthotopic tumor growth, accompanied with significant deregulation of genes mainly associated with cell cycle progression and pathways in cancer. Mechanistically PRMT2 is responsible for H3R8 asymmetric methylation (H3R8me2a), whose enrichment at promoters and enhancers is closely correlated with known active histone marks and is required for the maintenance of target gene expression. Together, this study demonstrates that PRMT2 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for oncogenic gene expression programs in GBM pathogenesis and provides a rationale for PRMT2 targeting in aggressive gliomas. The role of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) in epigenetic regulation in cancer is still poorly understood. Here, the authors show that PRMT2 is highly expressed in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and provide evidence that PRMT2 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for oncogenic gene expression programs, at least partly dependent on its H3R8me2a activity, in GBM pathogenesis.","authors":"Feng Dong; Qian Li; Chao Yang; Dawei Huo; Xing Wang; Chunbo Ai; Yu Kong; Xiaoyu Sun; Wen Wang; Yan Zhou; Xing Liu; Wei Li; Weiwei Gao; Wen Liu; Chunsheng Kang; Xudong Wu","keywords":"Histone post-translational modifications; Oncogenes","organization_affiliated":"Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China; Laboratory of Neuro-Oncology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Key Laboratory of Neurotrauma, Variation, and Regeneration, Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipal Government, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Neuropathology, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, 6 Tiantanxi Li, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Tianjin Nankai Hospital, Tianjin, China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China; Laboratory of Neuro-Oncology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Key Laboratory of Neurotrauma, Variation, and Regeneration, Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipal Government, Tianjin, China; Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Tianjin, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China","title":"PRMT2 links histone H3R8 asymmetric dimethylation to oncogenic activation and tumorigenesis of glioblastoma","id":"3e4c45f4-ea47-4ddf-877f-6de24c3ae341"}
{"abstract":"Our growing energy demands must be met by a sustainable supply with reduced carbon intensity. One of the most exciting prospects to realize this goal is the photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system which affords solar fuel/chemicals in high selectivity from CO2. Graphene based photocatalysts are highly suitable for the system, but their industrial scale use requires immobilization for improved separation and recovery of the photocatalyst. Therefore for practical purposes, design and fabrication of film type graphene photocatalyst with higher solar energy conversion efficiency is an absolute necessity. As a means to achieve this, we report herein the successful development of a new type of flexible graphene film photocatalyst that leads to \u003e225% rise in visible light harvesting efficiency of the resultant photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system for highly selective solar fuel production from CO2 compared to conventional spin coated graphene film photocatalyst. It is an important step towards the design of a new pool of graphene film based photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis of solar fuels from CO2.","authors":"Rajesh K.

{"abstract":"Mineralization of collagen is critical for the mechanical functions of bones and teeth. Calcium phosphate nucleation in collagenous structures follows distinctly different patterns in highly confined gap regions (nanoscale confinement) than in less confined extrafibrillar spaces (microscale confinement). Although the mechanism(s) driving these differences are still largely unknown, differences in the free energy for nucleation may explain these two mineralization behaviors. Here, we report on experimentally obtained nucleation energy barriers to intra- and extrafibrillar mineralization, using in situ X-ray scattering observations and classical nucleation theory. Polyaspartic acid, an extrafibrillar nucleation inhibitor, increases interfacial energies between nuclei and mineralization fluids. In contrast, the confined gap spaces inside collagen fibrils lower the energy barrier by reducing the reactive surface area of nuclei, decreasing the surface energy penalty. The confined gap geometry, therefore, guides the two-dimensional morphology and structure of bioapatite and changes the nucleation pathway by reducing the total energy barrier. Nucleation in highly confined gaps shows distinctly different behavior from nucleation in extrafibrillar spaces. Here, using in situ X-ray scattering and classical nucleation theory, the authors show how confined geometry reduces energy barriers to intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen.","authors":"Doyoon Kim; Byeongdu Lee; Stavros Thomopoulos; Young-Shin Jun","keywords":"Biomaterials; Biomineralization","organization_affiliated":"Department of Energy, Environmental \u0026 Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, USA; X-ray Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, USA; Department of Energy, Environmental \u0026 Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, USA","title":"The role of confined collagen geometry in decreasing nucleation energy barriers to intrafibrillar mineralization","id":"07c5b561-698f-457b-acab-2a26a036768c"}
{"abstract":"To develop and validate a clinical prediction model of patient-reported pain and function after undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). We used data of 1,649 patients from the Knee Arthroplasty Trial who received primary TKR across 34 centres in the UK. The external validation included 595 patients from Southampton University Hospital, and Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (Oxford). The outcome was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) 12-month after TKR. Pre-operative predictors including patient characteristics and clinical factors were considered. Bootstrap backward linear regression analysis was used. Low pre-operative OKS, living in poor areas, high body mass index, and patient-reported anxiety or depression were associated with worse outcome. The clinical factors associated with worse outcome were worse pre-operative physical status, presence of other conditions affecting mobility and previous knee arthroscopy. Presence of fixed flexion deformity and an absent or damaged pre-operative anterior cruciate ligament (compared with intact) were associated with better outcome. Discrimination and calibration statistics were satisfactory. External validation predicted 21.1% of the variance of outcome. This is the first clinical prediction model for predicting self-reported pain and function 12 months after TKR to be externally validated. It will help to inform to patients regarding expectations of the outcome after knee replacement surgery.","authors":"M. T. Sanchez-Santos; C. Garriga; A. Judge; R. N. Batra; A. J. Price; A. D.

{"abstract":"The predictive value of serum adiponectin for hypertensive cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. This study was performed to investigate the association of adiponectin with incident cardiovascular and renal events (CV events) in hypertensive patients. We performed post-hoc analysis on 1,228 hypertensive patients enrolled in the ATTEMPT-CVD study, a prospective randomized study comparing the effects of two antihypertensive therapies. The participants were divided into quartiles of baseline serum total adiponectin or high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to determine the prognostic factors associated with CV events. Kaplan-Meier analysis for CV events by quartiles of baseline total adiponectin showed that patients in the highest total adiponectin quartile (Q4) had more CV events (P = 0.0135). On the other hand, no significant difference was noted regarding the incidence of CV events among patients stratified by HMW adiponectin quartile (P = 0.2551). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, the highest total adiponectin quartile (Q4) remained independently associated with incident CV events in hypertensive patients (HR = 1.949: 95%CI 1.051–3.612; P = 0.0341). These results showed that total adiponectin, but not HMW adiponectin, was independently associated with the incidence of CV events in treated hypertensive patients, thereby highlighting total adiponectin as a valuable predictor for hypertensive cardiovascular outcomes.","authors":"Shokei Kim-Mitsuyama; Hirofumi Soejima; Osamu Yasuda; Koichi Node; Hideaki Jinnouchi; Eiichiro Yamamoto; Taiji Sekigami; Hisao Ogawa; Kunihiko Matsui","keywords":"Hypertension; Predictive markers","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Therapeutics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Health Care Center, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Sports and Life Sciences, National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Kanoya, Kanoya, Japan; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan; Diabetes Care Center, Jinnouchi Clinic, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Internal Medicine \u0026 Diabetes and Endocrine, Sekigami Clinic, Yatsushiro, Japan; National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Japan; Department of General and Community Medicine, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan","title":"Total adiponectin is associated with incident cardiovascular and renal events in treated hypertensive patients: subanalysis of the ATTEMPT-CVD randomized trial","id":"ac671a49-d864-411b-a80f-030c4e8b0e43"}
{"abstract":"Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a debilitating side effect that occurs in up to 30% of thoracic irradiations in breast and lung cancer patients. RIPF remains a major limiting factor to dose escalation and an obstacle to applying more promising new treatments for cancer cure. Limited treatment options are available to mitigate RIPF once it occurs, but recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and a drug treatment stimulating endogenous stem cells (GM-CSF) have been investigated for their potential in preventing this disease onset. In a pre-clinical rat model, we contrasted the application of longitudinal computed tomography (CT) imaging and classical histopathology to quantify RIPF and to evaluate the potential of MSCs in mitigating RIPF. Our results on histology demonstrate promises when MSCs are injected endotracheally (but not intravenously). While our CT analysis highlights the potential of GM-CSF treatment. Advantages and limitations of both analytical methods are contrasted in the context of RIPF.","authors":"Jessica R.

{"abstract":"Single-cell RNA sequencing allows defining molecularly distinct cell subpopulations. However, the identification of specific sets of transcription factors (TFs) that define the identity of these subpopulations remains a challenge. Here we propose that subpopulation identity emerges from the synergistic activity of multiple TFs. Based on this concept, we develop a computational platform (TransSyn) for identifying synergistic transcriptional cores that determine cell subpopulation identities. TransSyn leverages single-cell RNA-seq data, and performs a dynamic search for an optimal synergistic transcriptional core using an information theoretic measure of synergy. A large-scale TransSyn analysis identifies transcriptional cores for 186 subpopulations, and predicts identity conversion TFs between 3786 pairs of cell subpopulations. Finally, TransSyn predictions enable experimental conversion of human hindbrain neuroepithelial cells into medial floor plate midbrain progenitors, capable of rapidly differentiating into dopaminergic neurons. Thus, TransSyn can facilitate designing strategies for conversion of cell subpopulation identities with potential applications in regenerative medicine. Gaining insight into cell identities from single cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here, the authors introduce an approach to identify transcription factors (TFs) that synergistically determine cellular identities, and demonstrate its ability to identify TFs that can induce cellular conversion.","authors":"Satoshi Okawa; Carmen Saltó; Srikanth Ravichandran; Shanzheng Yang; Enrique M.

{"abstract":"While the effects of phytohormones on plant gene expression have been well characterized, comparatively little is known about how hormones influence metabolite profiles. This study examined the effects of elevated auxin and ethylene on the metabolome of Arabidopsis roots using a high-resolution 24 h time course, conducted in parallel to time-matched transcriptomic analyses. Mass spectrometry using orthogonal UPLC separation strategies (reversed phase and HILIC) in both positive and negative ionization modes was used to maximize identification of metabolites with altered levels. The findings show that the root metabolome responds rapidly to hormone stimulus and that compounds belonging to the same class of metabolites exhibit similar changes. The responses were dominated by changes in phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and fatty acid metabolism, although the nature and timing of the response was unique for each hormone. These alterations in the metabolome were not directly predicted by the corresponding transcriptome data, suggesting that post-transcriptional events such as changes in enzyme activity and/or transport processes drove the observed changes in the metabolome. These findings underscore the need to better understand the biochemical mechanisms underlying the temporal reconfiguration of plant metabolism, especially in relation to the hormone-metabolome interface and its subsequent physiological and morphological effects.","authors":"Sherry B.

{"abstract":"The activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit (α7nAChR) has been associated to anti-inflammatory response in macrophages. High-fat diet (HFD) consumption during pregnancy and lactation impairs the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in liver and white adipose tissue of offspring. In order to evaluate the relationship between damage in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and insulin resistance (IR) development, the liver of offspring of obese dams was investigated. Additionally, the capacity of α7nAChR activation to reduce IR induced by saturated fatty acid was investigated in hepatoma cell line. Initially, female mice were subjected to either standard chow (SC) or HFD during pregnancy and lactation period. After weaning, only male offspring from HFD dams (HFD-O) and SC dams (SC-O) were fed with the SC diet. Hepatic α7nAChR expression was downregulated, and hepatic TNF-α, IL-1β, and pIKK level, but not pJNK, were elevated in the HFD-O compared to SC-O mice. Besides, hepatic expression of TNF-α in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was higher in HFD-O than SC-O mice. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the AKT was lower in HFD-O compared to SC-O. Additionally, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the AKT in KOα7Alb-Cre mice fed HFD was lower than WT mice fed HFD. In hepatoma cell line, palmitate increased IL-6 and TNF-α expressions and pJNK level. These effects were accompanied by reduced capacity of insulin to stimulate AKT phosphorylation. PNU or nicotine reduced cytokine expression and JNK activation, but improved insulin resistance induced by palmitate. Our results suggest that maternal obesity impairs hepatic α7nAChR expression and AKT phosphorylation in the offspring. In vitro studies suggest that α7nAChR activation has potential to reduce deleterious effect of saturated fatty acids on insulin signalling.","authors":"S. O. Costa; C. M. Souza; P. G. Lanza; J. O.

{"abstract":"Attention deficits due to auditory distractibility are pervasive among patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). It remains unclear, however, whether attention deficits following ABI specific to auditory modality are associated with altered haemodynamic responses. Here, we examined cerebral haemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy combined with a topological vector-based analysis method. A total of thirty-seven participants (22 healthy adults, 15 patients with ABI) performed a melodic contour identification task (CIT) that simulates auditory distractibility. Findings demonstrated that the melodic CIT was able to detect auditory distractibility in patients with ABI. The rate-corrected score showed that the ABI group performed significantly worse than the non-ABI group in both CIT1 (target contour identification against environmental sounds) and CIT2 (target contour identification against target-like distraction). Phase-associated response intensity during the CITs was greater in the ABI group than in the non-ABI group. Moreover, there existed a significant interaction effect in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during CIT1 and CIT2. These findings indicated that stronger hemodynamic responses involving oxygen exchange in the left DLPFC can serve as a biomarker for evaluating and monitoring auditory distractibility, which could potentially lead to the discovery of the underlying mechanism that causes auditory attention deficits in patients with ABI.","authors":"Eunju Jeong; Hokyoung Ryu; Joon-Ho Shin; Gyu Hyun Kwon; Geonsang Jo; Ji-Yeong Lee","keywords":"Biomarkers; Neurological disorders; Rehabilitation","organization_affiliated":"Department of Arts and Technology, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Industrial Information Studies, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Arts and Technology, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Neurorehabilitation, National Rehabilitation Center, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Arts and Technology, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Arts and Technology, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Neurorehabilitation, National Rehabilitation Center, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"High Oxygen Exchange to Music Indicates Auditory Distractibility in Acquired Brain Injury: An fNIRS Study with a Vector-Based Phase Analysis","id":"bc30f322-2382-46b2-a691-4242e6df8aa4"}
{"abstract":"Type III CRISPR-Cas multisubunit complexes cleave ssRNA and ssDNA. These activities promote the generation of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA), which activates associated CRISPR-Cas RNases from the Csm/Csx families, triggering a massive RNA decay to provide immunity from genetic invaders. Here we present the structure of Sulfolobus islandicus (Sis) Csx1-cOA4 complex revealing the allosteric activation of its RNase activity. SisCsx1 is a hexamer built by a trimer of dimers. Each dimer forms a cOA4 binding site and a ssRNA catalytic pocket. cOA4 undergoes a conformational change upon binding in the second messenger binding site activating ssRNA degradation in the catalytic pockets. Activation is transmitted in an allosteric manner through an intermediate HTH domain, which joins the cOA4 and catalytic sites. The RNase functions in a sequential cooperative fashion, hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds in 5′-C-C-3′. The degradation of cOA4 by Ring nucleases deactivates SisCsx1, suggesting that this enzyme could be employed in biotechnological applications. Type III CRISPR-Cas RNases from the Csm and Csx families are activated by cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA).

{"abstract":"Spastin is a microtubule-severing AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protein needed for cell division and intracellular vesicle transport. Currently, we lack chemical inhibitors to probe spastin function in such dynamic cellular processes. To design a chemical inhibitor of spastin, we tested selected heterocyclic scaffolds against wild-type protein and constructs with engineered mutations in the nucleotide-binding site that do not substantially disrupt ATPase activity. These data, along with computational docking, guided improvements in compound potency and selectivity and led to spastazoline, a pyrazolyl-pyrrolopyrimidine-based cell-permeable probe for spastin. These studies also identified spastazoline-resistance-conferring point mutations in spastin. Spastazoline, along with the matched inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant cell lines we generated, were used in parallel experiments to dissect spastin-specific phenotypes in dividing cells. Together, our findings suggest how chemical probes for AAA proteins, along with inhibitor resistance-conferring mutations, can be designed and used to dissect dynamic cellular processes. The AAA protein spastin is needed for cell division and organelle transport. Testing spastin constructs with engineered mutations resulted in the identification of a chemical probe to analyze spastin-specific functions in cells.

Older inpatients aged ≥ 60 years with normal kidney function were included. Survival status and readmission information were assessed annually during the 3-year follow-up. We applied Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of sarcopenia for predicting mortality and readmission. We included 248 participants (mean age: 81.2 ± 6.6 years). During the follow-up, 57 participants (23.9%) died, whereas 179 participants (75.2%) were readmitted at least one time. The SI was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.214, p = 0.001), calf circumference (CC) (r = 0.253, p \u003c 0.001), handgrip strength (r = 0.244, p \u003c 0.001), and gait speed (r = 0.221, p \u003c 0.001).

{"abstract":"Animals searching for food and sexual partners often use odourant mixtures combining food-derived molecules and pheromones. For orientation, the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster uses three types of chemical cues: (i) the male volatile pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), (ii) sex-specific cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs; and CH-derived compounds), and (iii) food-derived molecules resulting from microbiota activity. To evaluate the effects of these chemicals on odour-tracking behaviour, we tested Drosophila individuals in a wind tunnel. Upwind flight and food preference were measured in individual control males and females presented with a choice of two food sources labelled by fly lines producing varying amounts of CHs and/or cVA. The flies originated from different species or strains, or their microbiota was manipulated. We found that (i) fly-labelled food could attract—but never repel—flies; (ii) the landing frequency on fly-labelled food was positively correlated with an increased flight duration; (iii) male—but not female or non-sex-specific—CHs tended to increase the landing frequency on fly-labelled food; (iv) cVA increased female—but not male—preference for cVA-rich food; and (v) microbiota-derived compounds only affected male upwind flight latency. Therefore, sex pheromones interact with food volatile chemicals to induce sex-specific flight responses in Drosophila.","authors":"Laurie Cazalé-Debat; Benjamin Houot; Jean-Pierre Farine; Claude Everaerts; Jean-François Ferveur","keywords":"Behavioural ecology; Chemical ecology","organization_affiliated":"Centre des Sciences du Go û t et de l’Alimentation, AgroSup, UMR6265 CNRS, UMR1324 INRA, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, 6, Bd Gabriel, Dijon, France; Centre des Sciences du Go û t et de l’Alimentation, AgroSup, UMR6265 CNRS, UMR1324 INRA, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, 6, Bd Gabriel, Dijon, France; Laboratoire de Biologie Fonctionnelle et Adaptative, UMR8251, Université Paris Diderot - Paris 7/CNRS Equipe Processus Dégénératifs, Stress et Vieillissement Bâtiment Buffon, 4, rue Marie Andrée Lagroua Weill Halle, Paris, France; Centre des Sciences du Go û t et de l’Alimentation, AgroSup, UMR6265 CNRS, UMR1324 INRA, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, 6, Bd Gabriel, Dijon, France; Centre des Sciences du Go û t et de l’Alimentation, AgroSup, UMR6265 CNRS, UMR1324 INRA, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, 6, Bd Gabriel, Dijon, France; Centre des Sciences du Go û t et de l’Alimentation, AgroSup, UMR6265 CNRS, UMR1324 INRA, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, 6, Bd Gabriel, Dijon, France","title":"Flying Drosophila show sex-specific attraction to fly-labelled food","id":"6d2d009f-7b39-4837-aba7-81e04d0d24ce"}
{"abstract":"The past decade witnesses considerable efforts to design acoustic illusion cloak that produces the desired scattered field for a specific object illuminated by an external field. Yet the possibility of generating acoustic illusion directly for a sound source still remains unexplored despite the great fundamental and practical significance, and previous transformation acoustics-based designs need to have bulky sizes in terms of working wavelength. Here we propose to produce arbitrary illusion for an airborne sound source with no need to resort to coordinate transformation method. Based on an inherently different mechanism that uses acoustic metasurface to provide azimuthally-dependent local phase delay to the radiated wavefront, we shrink the thickness of the single layer enclosing the source to subwavelength scale without modulating the shape of layer. The performance of our scheme is demonstrated via distinct phenomena of virtually shifting the source location and introducing angular momentum. Numerical results verify our theoretical predictions, showing the extraordinary capability of the presented device to freely manipulate the radiation pattern of a simplest point source, making it acoustically appearing like another arbitrarily complicated source. Our findings open new avenues to the design and application of acoustic illusion devices and may have deep implications in many diverse fields such as architectural acoustics and biomedical engineering.","authors":"Xu-Dong Fan; Bin Liang; Jing Yang; Jian-Chun Cheng","keywords":"Acoustics; Electronics, photonics and device physics","organization_affiliated":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures and Key Laboratory of Modern Acoustics, MOE, Institute of Acoustics, Department of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, P.

{"abstract":"Polarization-independent dielectric meta-lens is proposed to monolithically integrate with a HgCdTe infrared photodetector to concentrate power flux into a reduced photosensitive area for performance enhancement. Although a reduction in photosensitive area could suppress the dark current, the more seriously reduced light absorptance would degrade the specific detectivity D*. The integration of the meta-lens could reverse the situation by improving the absorptance of the photosensitive region. The meta-lens composed of an array of nano-pillars with varying diameters is formed by carving the CdZnTe substrate of the HgCdTe detector so that the integration could be accomplished in situ. The meta-lens focuses the incident light through the CdZnTe medium and at the HgCdTe photosensitive region. The focal spot is about the wavelength size and the focusing efficiency is above 63%. Concerning a HgCdTe detector with a pitch size of 40 μm × 40 μm, when the photosensitive area is reduced to 5 μm × 5 μm, the meta-lens could still keep the light absorptance above 50%, which is 49 times higher than that of the device without the meta-lens. The dark current reduces with the decreasing photosensitive area in a linear manner. When the photosensitive area shrinks from 40 μm × 40 μm to 10 μm × 10 μm or 5 μm × 5 μm, the dark current reduces by 16 or even 64 times. Compared to the pristine device, the employment of the meta-lens together with the reduction in photosensitive area could enhance D* by 5.5 times for the photosensitive area as 5 μm × 5 μm. Further, the meta-lens exhibits a good dispersion tolerance over the wavelength range from 3.3 μm to 5 μm. The averaged detectivity enhancement over this spectrum range is around 3 times for the photosensitive area as 5 μm × 5 μm. The angular response of the meta-lens integrated detector depends on the focal length. For a focal length of 73 µm or 38 µm, the angle of view for a 5 μm × 5 μm photosensitive area is 4.0° or 7.7°. For the inter-pillar distance to be 2 µm in our design, the influence of the coupling effect between the nano-pillars on the performance of the meta-lens is little.","authors":"Fangzhe Li; Jie Deng; Jing Zhou; Zeshi Chu; Yu Yu; Xu Dai; Huijun Guo; Lu Chen; Shangkun Guo; Mengke Lan; Xiaoshuang Chen","keywords":"Metamaterials; Mid-infrared photonics; Optoelectronic devices and components","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Infrared Imagining Material and Detectors, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; Key Laboratory of Infrared Imagining Material and Detectors, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Shanghai, China; School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","title":"HgCdTe mid-Infrared photo response enhanced by monolithically integrated meta-lenses","id":"4d2bc914-1da4-44ca-8dc0-2790aa5c6132"}

To investigate the potential correlation between GEFV grading and reflux finding score (RFS) in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD), 225 consecutive Patients with suspected LPRD who underwent both routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and laryngoscope were enrolled in our study. Patients with a RFS of more than 7 were diagnosed with LPRD. The GEFV was graded as I through IV according to Hill’s classification and was classified into two groups: normal GEFV group (grades I and II) and the abnormal GEFV group (grades III and IV). The percent of GEFV grades I to IV was 39.1%, 39.1%, 12.4%, and 9.3%, respectively. Age was significantly related to an abnormal GEFV (p = 0.002). Gender, BMI, smoke and alcohol were not related to GEFV grade. Fifty-one patients (22.67%) had positive RFS. Reflux finding scores were higher in GEFV grades III and IV than I and II (p \u003c 0.05). Endoscopic grading of GEFV is well correlated with reflux finding score in patients with LPRD.

A technically difficult problem is the efficient specimen transfer between different imaging modalities without losing the coordinates of the regions-of-interest (ROI). Here, we report a new and highly sensitive integrated system that combines a custom designed microscope with an ultramicrotome for in-resin-fluorescence detection in blocks, ribbons and sections on EM-grids. Although operating with long-distance lenses, this system achieves a very high light sensitivity. Our instrumental set-up and operating workflow are designed to investigate rare events in large tissue volumes. Applications range from studies of individual immune, stem and cancer cells to the investigation of non-uniform subcellular processes. As a use case, we present the ultrastructure of a single membrane repair patch on a muscle fiber in intact muscle in a whole animal context.","authors":"Nicolas Lemercier; Volker Middel; Didier Hentsch; Serge Taubert; Masanari Takamiya; Tanja Beil; Jean-Luc Vonesch; Tilo Baumbach; Patrick Schultz; Claude Antony; Uwe Strähle","keywords":"Cryoelectron tomography; Mechanical engineering; Software; Wide-field fluorescence microscopy","organization_affiliated":"Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany; Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Laboratory for Applications of Synchrotron Radiation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR7104, Illkirch, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, U964, Illkirch, France; Université de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France; Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany; Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany","title":"Microtome-integrated microscope system for high sensitivity tracking of in-resin fluorescence in blocks and ultrathin sections for correlative microscopy","id":"ce998146-b09b-41a0-9c10-c730584093f7"}
{"abstract":"Tumor cells form immune escape and subsequently obtain unlimited proliferation ability due to the abnormal immune surveillance mediated by immune checkpoints. Among this class of immune checkpoints, PD-1/PD-L1 was recognized as an anticancer drug target for many years, and so far, several monoclonal antibodies have achieved encouraging outcome in cancer treatment by targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. Due to the inherent limitations of antibodies, the development of small molecule inhibitors based on PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is gradually reviving in decades. In this review, we summarized a number of small molecule inhibitors based on three different therapeutic approaches interfering PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway: (1) blocking direct interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1; (2) inhibiting transcription and translation of PD-L1; and (3) promoting degradation of PD-L1 protein. The development of these small molecule inhibitors opens a new avenue for tumor immunotherapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway.","authors":"Qian Wu; Li Jiang; Si-cheng Li; Qiao-jun He; Bo Yang; Ji Cao","keywords":"Biomedicine, general; Pharmacology/Toxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine","organization_affiliated":"Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","title":"Small molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway","id":"2c7e5151-82cb-4c88-aad2-941639b06433"}
{"abstract":"Interneurons (INs) coordinate motoneuron activity to generate appropriate patterns of muscle contractions, providing animals with the ability to adjust their body posture and to move over a range of speeds. In Drosophila larvae several IN subtypes have been morphologically described and their function well documented. However, the general lack of molecular characterization of those INs prevents the identification of evolutionary counterparts in other animals, limiting our understanding of the principles underlying neuronal circuit organization and function. Here we characterize a restricted subset of neurons in the nerve cord expressing the Maf transcription factor Traffic Jam (TJ). We found that TJ+ neurons are highly diverse and selective activation of these different subtypes disrupts larval body posture and induces specific locomotor behaviors. Finally, we show that a small subset of TJ+ GABAergic INs, singled out by the expression of a unique transcription factors code, controls larval crawling speed. Spinal interneurons (IN) coordinate motoneuron activity to modulate locomotion behavior. Here, the authors characterize a subset of IN subtypes expressing the Maf transcription factor Traffic Jam (TJ) and report the distinct effects of their activation on body posture and locomotion in Drosophila larvae.","authors":"H.

Besides, the detailed evolution processes of intensity profile, polarization distribution and OAM value along the beam propagation distance is analyzed.

We propose a respiration guiding system based on real-time position management with suitable gating window for respiratory-gated radiotherapy applied to liver cancer. Between August 2016 and February 2018, 52 patients with liver cancer received training in real-time position management and respiration guiding. Respiration signals were statistically analysed during unguided respiration and when applying the respiration guiding system. Phases of 30–60% and 30–70% retrieved the lowest respiration variability among patients, and 47 patients exhibited significant differences in terms of respiration reproducibility between unguided and guided respiration. The results suggest that either of these phases can establish suitable windows for gated radiotherapy applied to liver cancer, especially regarding respiration reproducibility.","authors":"Se An Oh; Ji Woon Yea; Sung Kyu Kim; Jae Won Park","keywords":"Cancer; Hepatocellular carcinoma","organization_affiliated":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea; Department of Radiation Oncology, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea","title":"Optimal Gating Window for Respiratory-Gated Radiotherapy with Real-Time Position Management and Respiration Guiding System for Liver Cancer Treatment","id":"671b82bf-5745-45b1-a892-55f641b2d232"}
{"abstract":"Oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the age-related decline in the respiratory function. Adipokine in relation to the metabolic and inflammatory systems is attracting growing interest in the field of respiratory dysfunction. The present clinical and experimental studies investigated the role of the disulfide bond-forming oxidoreductase A-like protein (DsbA-L) gene, which has antioxidant and adiponectin multimeric (i.e. activation) properties, on the respiratory function of the elderly. We performed a retrospective longitudinal genotype-phenotype relationship analysis of 318 Japanese relatively elderly participants (mean age ± standard deviation: 67.0 ± 5.8 years) during a health screening program and an in vitro DsbA-L knock-down evaluation using 16HBE14o-cells, a commonly evaluated human airway epithelial cell line. The DsbA-L rs1917760 polymorphism was associated with a reduction in the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) and %FEV1 and with the elevation of the prevalence of FEV1/FVC \u003c 70%. We also confirmed that the polymorphism was associated with a decreased respiratory function in relation to a decrease in the ratio of high-molecular-weight adiponectin/total adiponectin (as a marker of adiponectin multimerization) and an increase in the oxidized human serum albumin (as an oxidative stress marker). Furthermore, we clarified that DsbA-L knock-down induced oxidative stress and up-regulated the mucus production in human airway epithelial cells. These findings suggest that the DsbA-L gene may play a role in protecting the respiratory function of the elderly, possibly via increased systemic adiponectin functions secreted from adipocytes or through systemic and/or local pulmonary antioxidant properties.","authors":"Kentaro Oniki; Hirofumi Nohara; Ryunosuke Nakashima; Yui Obata; Narumi Muto; Yuki Sakamoto; Keiko Ueno-Shuto; Tadashi Imafuku; Yu Ishima; Hiroshi Watanabe; Toru Maruyama; Koji Otake; Yasuhiro Ogata; Mary Ann Suico; Hirofumi Kai; Tsuyoshi Shuto; Junji Saruwatari","keywords":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Laboratory of Pharmacology, Division of Life Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sojo University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Japanese Red Cross Kumamoto Health Care Center, Kumamoto, Japan; Japanese Red Cross Kumamoto Health Care Center, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","title":"The DsbA-L gene is associated with respiratory function of the elderly via its adiponectin multimeric or antioxidant properties","id":"a51256f4-cae3-4bef-9a8f-aa9a0a1fb454"}
{"abstract":"The spatiotemporal regulation of Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane in response to extracellular signals is critical for development, stress response and reproduction, but is poorly understood. During flowering-plant reproduction, pollen tubes grow directionally to the ovule, which is guided by ovule-derived signals and dependent on Ca2+ dynamics. However, it is unknown how ovular signals are integrated with cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in the pollen tube. Here, we show that MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 5 (MLO5), MLO9 and MLO15 are required for pollen tube responses to ovular signals in Arabidopsis thaliana. Phenotypically distinct from the ovule-bypass phenotype of previously identified mutants, mlo5 mlo9 double-mutant and mlo5 mlo9 mlo15 triple-mutant pollen tubes twist and pile up after sensing the ovular cues. Molecular studies reveal that MLO5 and MLO9 selectively recruit Ca2+ channel CNGC18-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane through the R-SNARE proteins VAMP721 and VAMP722 in trans mode. This study identifies members of the conserved seven transmembrane MLO family (expressed in the pollen tube) as tethering factors for Ca2+ channels, reveals a novel mechanism of molecular integration of extracellular ovular cues and selective exocytosis, and sheds light on the general regulation of MLO proteins in cell responses to environmental stimuli. Pollen tubes constantly search for and respond to female cues for guided growth and efficient sperm delivery. In this study, the researchers characterized three MLO genes in Arabidopsis whose mutants showed twisting pollen tubes and deficiency in ovule targeting. As an ancient and vital gene family in plants, MLOs are also involved in pathogen resistance and plant–environment interactions.","authors":"Jiang-Guo Meng; Liang Liang; Peng-Fei Jia; Ying-Chun Wang; Hong-Ju Li; Wei-Cai Yang","keywords":"Extracellular signalling molecules; Pollen tube; Protein trafficking in plants","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Collage of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","title":"Integration of ovular signals and exocytosis of a Ca 2+ channel by MLOs in pollen tube guidance","id":"0046eb71-828c-4572-b9c7-b18d0a57a2d8"}
{"abstract":"Plant traits are both responsive to local climate and strong predictors of primary productivity. We hypothesized that future climate change might promote a shift in global plant traits resulting in changes in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We characterized the relationship between key plant traits, namely Specific Leaf Area (SLA), height, and seed mass, and local climate and primary productivity. We found that by 2070, tropical and arid ecosystems will be more suitable for plants with relatively lower canopy height, SLA and seed mass, while far northern latitudes will favor woody and taller plants than at present. Using a network of tower eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements and the extrapolated plant trait maps, we estimated the global distribution of annual GPP under current and projected future plant community distribution. We predict that annual GPP in northern biomes (≥45 °N) will increase by 31% (+8.1 ± 0.5 Pg C), but this will be offset by a 17.9% GPP decline in the tropics (−11.8 ± 0.84 Pg C). These findings suggest that regional climate changes will affect plant trait distributions, which may in turn affect global productivity patterns.","authors":"Nima Madani; John S. Kimball; Ashley P.

{"abstract":"Importance of growth factor (GF) signaling in cancer progression is widely acknowledged. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is known to play a key role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic cell transformation that are characterized by alterations in cell mechanical architecture and behavior towards a more robust and motile single cell phenotype. However, mechanisms mediating cancer type specific enhancement of cell mechanical phenotype in response to TGFβ remain poorly understood. Here, we combine high-throughput mechanical cell phenotyping, microarray analysis and gene-silencing to dissect cytoskeletal mediators of TGFβ-induced changes in mechanical properties of on-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Our experimental results show that elevation of rigidity and invasiveness of TGFβ-stimulated NSCLC cells correlates with upregulation of several cytoskeletal and motor proteins including vimentin, a canonical marker of EMT, and less-known unconventional myosins. Selective probing of gene-silenced cells lead to identification of unconventional myosin MYH15 as a novel mediator of elevated cell rigidity and invasiveness in TGFβ-stimulated NSCLC cells. Our experimental results provide insights into TGFβ-induced cytoskeletal remodeling of NSCLC cells and suggest that mediators of elevated cell stiffness and migratory activity such as unconventional cytoskeletal and motor proteins may represent promising pharmaceutical targets for restraining invasive spread of lung cancer.","authors":"E.

Moreover, in this scheme, any one of the participants does not know the other participants’ shares, even the trusted reconstructor Bob 1 is no exception. The transformation of the particles includes some simple operations such as d-level CNOT, Quantum Fourier Transform(QFT), Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform(IQFT), and generalized Pauli operator. The transformed particles need not to be transmitted from one participant to another in the quantum channel. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can resist intercept-resend attack, entangle-measure attack, collusion attack, and forgery attack. Performance comparison shows that it has lower computation and communication costs than other similar schemes when 2 \u003c t \u003c n − 1.","authors":"Xiu-Li Song; Yan-Bing Liu; Hong-Yao Deng; Yong-Gang Xiao","keywords":"Information technology; Information theory and computation","organization_affiliated":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing, China; Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing, China; Yangtze Normal University, College of Computer Engineering, Chongqing, China; Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing, China","title":"( t , n ) Threshold d -Level Quantum Secret Sharing","id":"fe6bdd6a-46b4-4c4f-a7d8-d0e3b5ce63b8"}
{"abstract":"Measurement-device-independent entanglement witness (MDI-EW) plays an important role for detecting entanglement with untrusted measurement device. We present a double blinding-attack on a quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol based on GHZ state. Using the MDI-EW method, we propose a QSS protocol against all detector side-channels. We allow source flaws in practical QSS system, so that Charlie can securely distribute a key between the two agents Alice and Bob over long distances. Our protocol provides condition on the extracted key rate for the secret against both external eavesdropper and arbitrary dishonest participants. A tight bound for collective attacks can provide good bounds on the practical QSS with source flaws. Then we show through numerical simulations that using single-photon source a secure QSS over 136 km can be achieved.","authors":"Xiuqing Yang; Kejin Wei; Haiqiang Ma; Hongwei Liu; Zhenqiang Yin; Zhu Cao; Lingan Wu","keywords":"Quantum information; Quantum mechanics","organization_affiliated":"College of Science, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, China; Guangxi Key Laboratory for Relativistic Astrophysics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China; School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Laboratory of Optical Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","title":"Detector-device-independent quantum secret sharing with source flaws","id":"b9345f03-50d1-4cf5-bf5b-8a16148deaa5"}
{"abstract":"Some cancer therapies damage DNA and cause mutations in both cancerous and healthy cells. Therapy-induced mutations may underlie some of the long-term and late side effects of treatments, such as mental disabilities, organ toxicity and secondary neoplasms. Nevertheless, the burden of mutation contributed by different chemotherapies has not been explored. Here we identify the mutational signatures or footprints of six widely used anticancer therapies across more than 3,500 metastatic tumors originating from different organs. These include previously known and new mutational signatures generated by platinum-based drugs as well as a previously unknown signature of nucleoside metabolic inhibitors. Exploiting these mutational footprints, we estimate the contribution of different treatments to the mutation burden of tumors and their risk of contributing coding and potential driver mutations in the genome. The mutational footprints identified here allow for precise assessment of the mutational risk of different cancer therapies to understand their long-term side effects. Analysis of whole-genome sequences from more than 3,500 metastatic tumors identifies mutational signatures associated with different chemotherapies and provides estimates of the relative contribution of different treatments to tumor mutational burden.","authors":"Oriol Pich; Ferran Muiños; Martijn Paul Lolkema; Neeltje Steeghs; Abel Gonzalez-Perez; Nuria Lopez-Bigas","keywords":"Cancer; Cancer therapy; Genome informatics","organization_affiliated":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain; Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain; Research Program on Biomedical Informatics, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain; Research Program on Biomedical Informatics, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona, Spain","title":"The mutational footprints of cancer therapies","id":"bccbd78b-d385-459b-b94b-1a232bd1bdc6"}
{"abstract":"Animal-based studies have provided important insights into the structural and functional consequences of noise exposure on the cochlea. Yet, less is known about the molecular mechanisms by which noise induces cochlear damage, particularly at relatively low exposure levels. While there is ample evidence that noise exposure leads to changes in inner ear metabolism, the specific effects of noise exposure on the cochlear metabolome are poorly understood. In this study we applied liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics to analyze the effects of noise on the mouse inner ear. Mice were exposed to noise that induces temporary threshold shifts, synaptopathy and permanent hidden hearing loss. Inner ears were harvested immediately after exposure and analyzed by targeted metabolomics for the relative abundance of 220 metabolites across the major metabolic pathways in central carbon metabolism. We identified 40 metabolites differentially affected by noise. Our approach detected novel noise-modulated metabolites and pathways, as well as some already linked to noise exposure or cochlear function such as neurotransmission and oxidative stress. Furthermore, it showed that metabolic effects of noise on the inner ear depend on the intensity and duration of exposure. Collectively, our results illustrate that metabolomics provides a powerful approach for the characterization of inner ear metabolites affected by auditory trauma. This type of information could lead to the identification of drug targets and novel therapies for noise-induced hearing loss.","authors":"Lingchao Ji; Ho-Joon Lee; Guoqiang Wan; Guo-Peng Wang; Li Zhang; Peter Sajjakulnukit; Jochen Schacht; Costas A.

{"abstract":"Protein kinases are enzymes whose abundance, protein-protein interactions, and posttranslational modifications together determine net signaling activity in cells. Large-scale data on cellular kinase activity are limited, because existing assays are cumbersome, poorly sensitive, low throughput, and restricted to measuring one kinase at a time. Here, we surmount the conventional hurdles of activity measurement with a multiplexing approach that leverages the selectivity of individual kinase-substrate pairs. We demonstrate proof of concept by designing an assay that jointly measures activity of five pleiotropic signaling kinases: Akt, IκB kinase (IKK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular regulated kinase kinase (MEK), and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2). The assay operates in a 96-well format and specifically measures endogenous kinase activation with coefficients of variation less than 20%. Multiplex tracking of kinase-substrate pairs reduces input requirements by 25-fold, with ~75 µg of cellular extract sufficient for fiveplex activity profiling. We applied the assay to monitor kinase signaling during coxsackievirus B3 infection of two different host-cell types and identified multiple differences in pathway dynamics and coordination that warrant future study. Because the Akt–IKK–JNK–MEK–MK2 pathways regulate many important cellular functions, the fiveplex assay should find applications in inflammation, environmental-stress, and cancer research.","authors":"Christian M.

{"abstract":"Plant organs consist of multiple cell types that do not operate in isolation, but communicate with each other to maintain proper functions. Here, we extract models specific to three developmental stages of eight root cell types or tissue layers in Arabidopsis thaliana based on a state-of-the-art constraint-based modeling approach with all publicly available transcriptomics and metabolomics data from this system to date. We integrate these models into a multi-cell root model which we investigate with respect to network structure, distribution of fluxes, and concordance to transcriptomics and proteomics data. From a methodological point, we show that the coupling of tissue-specific models in a multi-tissue model yields a higher specificity of the interconnected models with respect to network structure and flux distributions. We use the extracted models to predict and investigate the flux of the growth hormone indole-3-actetate and its antagonist, trans-Zeatin, through the root. While some of predictions are in line with experimental evidence, constraints other than those coming from the metabolic level may be necessary to replicate the flow of indole-3-actetate from other simulation studies. Therefore, our work provides the means for data-driven multi-tissue metabolic model extraction of other Arabidopsis organs in the constraint-based modeling framework.","authors":"Michael Scheunemann; Siobhan M.

{"abstract":"Free-form optoelectronic devices can provide hyper-connectivity over space and time. However, most conformable optoelectronic devices can only be fabricated on flat polymeric materials using low-temperature processes, limiting their application and forms. This paper presents free-form optoelectronic devices that are not dependent on the shape or material. For medical applications, the transferable OLED (10 μm) is formed in a sandwich structure with an ultra-thin transferable barrier (4.8 μm). The results showed that the fabricated sandwich-structure transferable OLED (STOLED) exhibit the same high-efficiency performance on cylindrical-shaped materials and on materials such as textile and paper. Because the neutral axis is freely adjustable using the sandwich structure, the textile-based OLED achieved both folding reliability and washing reliability, as well as a long operating life (\u003e150 h). When keratinocytes were irradiated with red STOLED light, cell proliferation and cell migration increased by 26 and 32%, respectively. In the skin equivalent model, the epidermis thickness was increased by 39%; additionally, in organ culture, not only was the skin area increased by 14%, but also, re-epithelialization was highly induced. Based on the results, the STOLED is expected to be applicable in various wearable and disposable photomedical devices. Korean scientists have developed an ultrathin flexible optoelectronic device for use in patches that can be worn on the skin to promote wound healing or to treat diseased cells. Optoelectronic devices that have no fixed shape and are flexible, wearable and disposable are attracting considerable attention as they can be placed close to the skin, providing an effective way to treat wounds. However, making conventional wearable optoelectronics requires complicated processes and produces poorly performing devices with short operating lifetimes. Now, Kyung Cheol Choi and colleagues from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in the Republic of Korea have made a reliable and high performing sandwich-structure ultrathin organic light-emitting diode. The device paves the way for wearable and disposable patches for healing wounds and other types of phototherapy.","authors":"Yongmin Jeon; Hye-Ryung Choi; Jeong Hyun Kwon; Seungyeop Choi; Kyung Mi Nam; Kyoung-Chan Park; Kyung Cheol Choi","keywords":"Optoelectronic devices and components; Organic LEDs","organization_affiliated":"School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), Seongnam, Republic of Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), Seongnam, Republic of Korea; Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), Seongnam, Republic of Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea","title":"Sandwich-structure transferable free-form OLEDs for wearable and disposable skin wound photomedicine","id":"a5a57113-0eba-4f48-b35c-1640d9037432"}
{"abstract":"Bacillus cytotoxicus is a member of the Bacillus cereus group linked to fatal cases of diarrheal disease. Information on B. cytotoxicus is very limited; in particular comprehensive genomic data is lacking. Thus, we applied a genomic approach to characterize B. cytotoxicus and decipher its population structure. To this end, complete genomes of ten B. cytotoxicus were sequenced and compared to the four publicly available full B. cytotoxicus genomes and genomes of other B. cereus group members. Average nucleotide identity, core genome, and pan genome clustering resulted in clear distinction of B. cytotoxicus strains from other strains of the B. cereus group. Genomic content analyses showed that a hydroxyphenylalanine operon is present in B. cytotoxicus, but absent in all other members of the B. cereus group. It enables degradation of aromatic compounds to succinate and pyruvate and was likely acquired from another Bacillus species. It allows for utilization of tyrosine and might have given a B. cytotoxicus ancestor an evolutionary advantage resulting in species differentiation. Plasmid content showed that B. cytotoxicus is flexible in exchanging genes, allowing for quick adaptation to the environment. Genome-based phylogenetic analyses divided the B. cytotoxicus strains into four clades that also differed in virulence gene content.","authors":"Marc J. A.

{"abstract":"Building a quantum computer with a one-dimensional (1D) architecture, instead of the typical two-dimensional (2D) layout, could be significantly less difficult experimentally. However such a restricted topology necessitates a large overhead for shuffling qubits and consequently the fault tolerance threshold is far lower than in 2D architectures. Here we identify a middle ground: a 1D segmented chain which is a linear array of segments, each of which is a well-connected zone with all-to-all connectivity. The architecture is relevant to both ion trap and solid-state systems. We establish that fault tolerance can be achieved either by a surface code alone, or via an additional concatenated four-qubit gauge code. We find that the fault tolerance threshold is 0.12%, a feasible error rate with today’s technology, using 15-qubit segments, while larger segments are superior. For 35 or more qubits per segment one can achieve computation on a meaningful scale with today’s state-of-the-art fidelities without the use of the upper concatenation layer, thus minimising the overall device size. A quantum computer with components arranged on a line instead of more complex architectures could actually work, and be experiment-friendly. Ying Li and Simon Benjamin from University of Oxford propose a structure composed of many subunits arranged in 1D, each of them being a small set of qubits with all-to-all connections, and proved that, given the current performances of ion traps or solid-state systems, it could reach operativity already with around 15 qubits per subunit. This architecture would be much easier to realise than the ones currently being sought after, since it would get rid of the necessity to access the qubits from the z-direction, allowing the whole circuit (inclusive of controls) to be built on a 2D surface.","authors":"Ying Li; Simon C.

Participants provided information on the performance of moderate or vigorous activities and walking exercise and this was used to determine total metabolic equivalents (METs) minutes of activity per week. Successful aging status was determined through interviewer-administered questionnaire and was classified as the absence of: depressive symptoms, disability, cognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms and systemic conditions (e.g. cancer, coronary artery disease). 249 (15.7%) participants (mean age 59.9 ± 6.1) had aged successfully 10 years later.

Locals use these aerial roots to build living bridges, which strengthen themselves over time due to adaptive secondary growth and their capacity to form a mechanically stable structure via inosculations. An extensive inventory of LRBs in Meghalaya including data of location, altitude, approximate age and bridge length was performed in field studies. Root morphology was characterised by measurements of cross-sectional area and shape-related parameters and analysed in relation to the orientation of the roots. LRBs are found to occur mainly in the mountainous limestone rainforests where F. elastica may be native or traditionally cultivated. They cover an altitude range of 57–1211 m a.m.s.l. and display a length of 2 to 52.7 m. Some bridges are several hundreds of years old. Horizontally and vertically trained roots differ significantly in shape and cross-sectional area when approximately even-aged roots are compared.

{"abstract":"Extensive studies on metastasis-associated proteins, S100A4 and MTA1, have been carried out for over two decades, but correlation of both proteins remains obscure. Here we show evidence for the correlation in angiogenesis. First, silencing of each protein by siRNA-mediated knockdown in mouse endothelial MSS31 cells resulted in the inhibition of tube formation. Unexpectedly, the knockdown of MTA1 affected not only its own expression but also the expression of S100A4, whereas silencing of S100A4 did not affect the MTA1 expression. Additionally, non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) phosphorylation, which was partly controlled by S100A4, was found to be upregulated by knockdown of both proteins in MSS31 cells. Moreover, cycloheximide treatment of MSS31 cells revealed that the rate of S100A4 degradation was accelerated by MTA1 knockdown. This finding, together with our observation that cytoplasmic MTA1, but not nuclear MTA1, was colocalized with S100A4, suggested the involvement of MTA1 in S100A4 stability. The direct in vivo angiogenesis assay showed that both protein siRNAs provoked a significant inhibition of new blood vessel formation induced by angiogenic factors, indicating their anti-angiogenic activities. Treatment of human pancreatic tumor (PANC-1) xenograft in mice with mMTA1 siRNA resulted in tumor regression via suppression of angiogenesis in vivo, as also observed in the case of human prostate cancer xenograft treated with mS100A4 siRNA. Taken together, these data led us to conclude that the MTA1–S100A4–NMIIA axis exists in endothelial cells as a novel pathway in promoting tumor vascular formation and could be a target for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis.","authors":"Mizuho Ishikawa; Mitsuhiko Osaki; Makoto Yamagishi; Kunishige Onuma; Hisao Ito; Futoshi Okada; Hideya Endo","keywords":"Cancer prevention; Tumour angiogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Division of Pathological Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Division of Pathological Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Chromosome Engineering Research Center, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Pathological Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Division of Pathological Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Division of Pathological Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Chromosome Engineering Research Center, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan; Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan","title":"Correlation of two distinct metastasis-associated proteins, MTA1 and S100A4, in angiogenesis for promoting tumor growth","id":"83445589-bd4d-4d89-8807-d8f7e1065a76"}
{"abstract":"Due to the substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. This paper presents the characteristic radar micro-Doppler properties of drones and birds. Drones and birds both induce micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wingbeats, respectively. These distinctive signatures can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Here, experimental measurements of micro-Doppler signatures of different types of drones and birds are presented and discussed. The data have been collected using two radars operating at different frequencies; K-band (24 GHz) and W-band (94 GHz). Three different models of drones and four species of birds of varying sizes have been used for data collection. The results clearly demonstrate that a phase coherent radar system can retrieve highly reliable and distinctive micro-Doppler signatures of these flying targets, both at K-band and W-band. Comparison of the signatures obtained at the two frequencies indicates that the micro-Doppler return from the W-band radar has higher SNR. However, micro-Doppler features in the K-band radar returns also reveal the micro-motion characteristics of drones and birds very effectively.","authors":"Samiur Rahman; Duncan A.

{"abstract":"Dispatchable energy storage is necessary to enable renewable-based power systems that have zero or very low carbon emissions. The inherent degradation behaviour of electrochemical energy storage (EES) is a major concern for both EES operational decisions and EES economic assessments. Here, we propose a decision framework that addresses the intertemporal trade-offs in terms of EES degradation by deriving, implementing and optimizing two metrics: the marginal benefit of usage and the average benefit of usage. These metrics are independent of the capital cost of the EES system, and, as such, separate the value of EES use from the initial cost, which provides a different perspective on storage valuation and operation. Our framework is proved to produce the optimal solution for EES life-cycle profit maximization. We show that the proposed framework offers effective ways to assess the economic values of EES, to make investment decisions for various applications and to inform related subsidy policies. Application-specific duty profiles can have a substantial effect on the degradation of utility-scale electrochemical batteries. Here, the researchers propose a framework for controlling battery use in a manner that maximizes the life-cycle benefit of batteries, taking both tariffs and long- and short-term battery degradation into account.","authors":"Guannan He; Qixin Chen; Panayiotis Moutis; Soummya Kar; Jay F.

{"abstract":"Cryopreservation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) facilitated their commercial availability for use in vascular biology, tissue engineering and drug delivery research; however, the key variables in HUVEC cryopreservation have not been comprehensively studied. HUVECs are typically cryopreserved by cooling at 1 °C/min in the presence of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). We applied interrupted slow cooling (graded freezing) and interrupted rapid cooling with a hold time (two-step freezing) to identify where in the cooling process cryoinjury to HUVECs occurs. We found that linear cooling at 1 °C/min resulted in higher membrane integrities than linear cooling at 0.2 °C/min or nonlinear two-step freezing. DMSO addition procedures and compositions were also investigated. By combining hydroxyethyl starch with DMSO, HUVEC viability after cryopreservation was improved compared to measured viabilities of commercially available cryopreserved HUVECs and viabilities for HUVEC cryopreservation studies reported in the literature. Furthermore, HUVECs cryopreserved using our improved procedure showed high tube forming capability in a post-thaw angiogenesis assay, a standard indicator of endothelial cell function. As well as presenting superior cryopreservation procedures for HUVECs, the methods developed here can serve as a model to optimize the cryopreservation of other cells.","authors":"A.

{"abstract":"Machine learning (ML) techniques such as (deep) artificial neural networks (DNN) are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks and provide new predictive models for complex physical, chemical, biological and social systems. However, in most cases this comes with the disadvantage of acting as a black box, rarely providing information about what made them arrive at a particular prediction. This black box aspect of ML techniques can be problematic especially in medical diagnoses, so far hampering a clinical acceptance. The present paper studies the uniqueness of individual gait patterns in clinical biomechanics using DNNs. By attributing portions of the model predictions back to the input variables (ground reaction forces and full-body joint angles), the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique reliably demonstrates which variables at what time windows of the gait cycle are most relevant for the characterisation of gait patterns from a certain individual. By measuring the time-resolved contribution of each input variable to the prediction of ML techniques such as DNNs, our method describes the first general framework that enables to understand and interpret non-linear ML methods in (biomechanical) gait analysis and thereby supplies a powerful tool for analysis, diagnosis and treatment of human gait.","authors":"Fabian Horst; Sebastian Lapuschkin; Wojciech Samek; Klaus-Robert Müller; Wolfgang I.

{"abstract":"EGFR-mutant lung cancer (LC) patients display a poor response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. In the absence of independent genetic validation, whether EGFR mutation distorts host antitumor immunity is unknown. Here, we showed that in the clinic, LC with the E746-A750 deletion mutation (EGFR-19del) displayed a temporal association with the loss of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. In a xenograft model, EGFR-19del-expressing Lewis lung cancer (LLC) tumors had a low T cell density at the early stage of tumor development, along with dendritic cells (DCs) exhibiting variant phenotypes in the tumors and draining lymph nodes (LNs). Importantly, EGFR-19del DCs were observed in the LNs of tumor-bearing mice and LC patients. The proliferative activity of T cells within the LN was significantly dampened. In vitro experiments indicated that the function of DCs was repressed by EGFR-19del LLC cells through exosome uptake in which exosomes derived from the EGFR-19del LLC cells could efficiently transfer active EGFR-19del to the surface of the DCs. Injection of EGFR-19del tumor-derived exosomes promoted LLC tumor progression and induced immunosuppression. The combination of gefitinib and GM-CSF treatment recovered tumor T cell infiltration in EGFR-19del tumors by rescuing the function of DCs and increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatment. Together, these results indicated that LC with the EGFR E746-A750 deletion mutation induced anergic DCs to repress antitumor immunity through exosomes.","authors":"Shaorong Yu; Huanhuan Sha; Xiaobing Qin; Yan Chen; Xiaoyou Li; Meiqi Shi; Jifeng Feng","keywords":"Lung cancer; Tumour immunology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, XuZhou, China; Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China; Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University \u0026 Jiangsu Cancer Hospital \u0026 Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China","title":"EGFR E746-A750 deletion in lung cancer represses antitumor immunity through the exosome-mediated inhibition of dendritic cells","id":"fae21581-c820-4263-afb3-8de981614f72"}
{"abstract":"Manju Kurian and colleagues report heterozygous variants in KMT2B in 27 unrelated individuals with a complex progressive childhood-onset dystonia, often associated with a typical facial appearance. Their findings highlight a clinically recognizable form of dystonia and demonstrate a crucial role for KMT2B in the physiological control of voluntary movement. Histone lysine methylation, mediated by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins, is now known to be critical in the regulation of gene expression, genomic stability, cell cycle and nuclear architecture. Despite MLL proteins being postulated as essential for normal development, little is known about the specific functions of the different MLL lysine methyltransferases. Here we report heterozygous variants in the gene KMT2B (also known as MLL4) in 27 unrelated individuals with a complex progressive childhood-onset dystonia, often associated with a typical facial appearance and characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging findings. Over time, the majority of affected individuals developed prominent cervical, cranial and laryngeal dystonia. Marked clinical benefit, including the restoration of independent ambulation in some cases, was observed following deep brain stimulation (DBS). These findings highlight a clinically recognizable and potentially treatable form of genetic dystonia, demonstrating the crucial role of KMT2B in the physiological control of voluntary movement.","authors":"Esther Meyer;

{"abstract":"Since the last 5–10 years the relevance of the gut microbiome on different intestinal illnesses has been revealed. Recent findings indicate the effect of gut microbiome on certain dermatological diseases such as atopic dermatitis. However, data on other skin diseases such as psoriasis are limited. This is the first time attempting to reveal the gut microbiome composition of psoriatic patients with a prospective study including a group of patients with plaque psoriasis, analyzing their gut microbiome and the relationship between the microbiome composition and bacterial translocation. The microbiome of a cohort of 52 psoriatic patients (PASI score ≥6) was obtained by 16s rRNA massive sequencing with MiSeq platform (Illumina inc, San Diego) with an average of 85,000 sequences per sample. The study of the gut microbiome and enterotype shows from the first time a specific “psoriatic core intestinal microbiome” that clearly differs from the one present in healthy population. In addition, those psoriatic patients classified as belonging to enterotype 2 tended to experience more frequent bacterial translocation and higher inflammatory status (71%) than patients with other enterotypes (16% for enterotype 1; and 21% for enterotype 3).","authors":"Francisco M.

{"abstract":"Populating transient and partially unfolded species is a crucial step in the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibrils formed from pathogenic variants of human lysozyme linked with a rare but fatal hereditary systemic amyloidosis. The partially unfolded species possess an unstructured β-domain and C-helix with the rest of the α-domain remaining native-like. Here we use paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measured by NMR spectroscopy to study the transient intermolecular interactions between such intermediate species. Nitroxide spin labels, introduced specifically at three individual lysine residues, generate distinct PRE profiles, indicating the presence of intermolecular interactions between residues within the unfolded β-domain. This study describes the applicability to PRE NMR measurements of selective lysine labeling, at different sites within a protein, as an alternative to the introduction of spin labels via engineered cysteine residues. These results reveal the importance of the β-sheet region of lysozyme for initiating self-assembly into amyloid fibrils.","authors":"Minkoo Ahn; Christopher A.

{"abstract":"Macro- and microorganism activities are important for the effectiveness of the slow sand filtration (SSF), where native microorganisms remove contaminants mainly by substrate competition, predation, and antagonism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the addition of the oligodynamic metals iron, copper, and brass, inserted separately into SSF to enhance pollutant removal in water samples. Four laboratory-scale SSFs were built and tested: control, iron, copper, and brass. Water analysis included physicochemical evaluation, total and fecal coliform quantification. An analysis on microbial communities in the SSFs schmutzdecke was achieved by using 16S rRNA amplification, the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the QIIME bioinformatics software. The results demonstrated that inorganic and organic contaminants such as coliforms were removed up to 90%. The addition of metals had no significant effect (p \u003e 0.05) on the other parameters. The microbial community analysis demonstrated different compositions of the SSF with brass-influent, where the eukaryote Streptophyta was predominant (31.4%), followed by the acetic acid bacteria Gluconobacter (24.6%), and Acetobacteraceae (7.7%), these genera were absent in the other SSF treatments. In conclusion, the use of a SSF system can be a low cost alternative to reduce microbial contamination in water and thus reduce gastrointestinal diseases in rural areas.","authors":"Ma. Carmen E.

{"abstract":"The Australian koala is an iconic marsupial with highly specific dietary requirements distributed across heterogeneous environments, over a large geographic range. The distribution and genetic structure of koala populations has been heavily influenced by human actions, specifically habitat modification, hunting and translocation of koalas. There is currently limited information on population diversity and gene flow at a species-wide scale, or with consideration to the potential impacts of local adaptation. Using species-wide sampling across heterogeneous environments, and high-density genome-wide markers (SNPs and PAVs), we show that most koala populations display levels of diversity comparable to other outbred species, except for those populations impacted by population reductions. Genetic clustering analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction reveals a lack of support for current taxonomic classification of three koala subspecies, with only a single evolutionary significant unit supported. Furthermore, ~70% of genetic variance is accounted for at the individual level. The Sydney Basin region is highlighted as a unique reservoir of genetic diversity, having higher diversity levels (i.e., Blue Mountains region; AvHecorr=0.20, PL% = 68.6). Broad-scale population differentiation is primarily driven by an isolation by distance genetic structure model (49% of genetic variance), with clinal local adaptation corresponding to habitat bioregions. Signatures of selection were detected between bioregions, with no single region returning evidence of strong selection. The results of this study show that although the koala is widely considered to be a dietary-specialist species, this apparent specialisation has not limited the koala’s ability to maintain gene flow and adapt across divergent environments as long as the required food source is available.","authors":"Shannon R.

{"abstract":"The memory effects in non-Markovian quantum dynamics can induce the revival of quantum coherence, which is believed to provide important physical resources for quantum information processing (QIP). However, no real quantum algorithms have been demonstrated with the help of such memory effects. Here, we experimentally implemented a non-Markovianity-assisted high-fidelity refined Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm (RDJA) with a solid spin in diamond. The memory effects can induce pronounced non-monotonic variations in the RDJA results, which were confirmed to follow a non-Markovian quantum process by measuring the non-Markovianity of the spin system. By applying the memory effects as physical resources with the assistance of dynamical decoupling, the probability of success of RDJA was elevated above 97% in the open quantum system. This study not only demonstrates that the non-Markovianity is an important physical resource but also presents a feasible way to employ this physical resource. It will stimulate the application of the memory effects in non-Markovian quantum dynamics to improve the performance of practical QIP. Scientists have successfully applied the non-Markovianity of environment as an important quantum resource to improve the performance of quantum information processing. Quantum system unavoidably suffers from notorious decoherence, which is a primary hurdle for wide applications of quantum information techniques in realistic quantum system. Unlike to passively shield the decoherence, a team led by Fang-Wen Sun at University of Science and Technology of China actively utilized the memory effect of a non-Markovian environment, a typical quantum decoherence environment, to revive quantum coherence and correlation and to improve the fidelity of quantum Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center. This study not only demonstrates that the non-Markovianity is an important quantum resource but also presents a feasible way to employ this physical resource for quantum information techniques.","authors":"Yang Dong; Yu Zheng; Shen Li; Cong-Cong Li; Xiang-Dong Chen; Guang-Can Guo; Fang-Wen Sun","keywords":"Quantum information; Quantum optics","organization_affiliated":"CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; CAS Key Lab of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information \u0026 Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","title":"Non-Markovianity-assisted high-fidelity Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm in diamond","id":"f041bb91-1572-4188-9cb0-fe6635f45179"}

Laser written structures of different aspect ratio (height to width) on a copper surface tuned the SEY of the surface and reduced its value to less than unity. The aspect ratio of microstructures was methodically controlled by varying the laser parameters. The results obtained corroborate a recent theoretical model of SEY reduction as a function of the aspect ratio of microstructures.

{"abstract":"Cadmium is an environmental contaminant that can activate estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer. Our lab previously demonstrated that chronic cadmium exposure alters the expression of several ERα-responsive genes and increases the malignancy of breast cancer cells. Although these studies support cadmium’s function as a hormone disrupter, the role of ERα in cadmium-induced breast cancer progression remains unclear. To address this, we modulated the expression of ERα and found that while the loss of ERα significantly impaired cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth in both MCF7 and MCF7-Cd cells, cadmium-exposed cells retained a significant advantage in cell growth, migration, and invasion, and partially circumvented the loss of ERα. ERα knockout in MCF7 and MCF7-Cd cells significantly reduced the expression of classical ERα-regulated genes, while non-classical ERα-regulated genes were less impacted by the loss of ERα in MCF7-Cd cells. This is the first study to show that chronic cadmium exposure, even at low levels, can increase the malignancy of breast cancer cells by decreasing their dependency on ERα and increasing the adaptability of the cancer cells.","authors":"Mathew Bloomfield; Maggie C.

{"abstract":"There is robust experimental evidence for contagious yawning, yet observational studies of naturalistic behavior have been fewer. Without data from real-world behavior, researchers have questioned the existence of contagious yawning and made assumptions about some parameters (e.g., the duration of the effect). We observed contagious yawning in chimpanzees to confirm/disconfirm its existence in the behavioral repertoire of this species, and if present, provide some of the missing descriptives. We recorded yawns on an all-occurrence basis from 18 captive-reared chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo. We recorded identity, time, and individuals who could have been affected. We calculated a threshold for contagion by taking the mean and adding 1.96 standard deviations, constructing a response curve. Across multiple measures we see a consistent pattern in which there is a strong effect of contagion for 1.5 minutes, a less strong but still significant effect lasting up to 3.5 minutes in some measures, and no evidence of contagion beyond 3.5 minutes. From the time stamp on each yawn we were able to rule out temporal synchrony as an alternative hypothesis. Thus, contagious yawning appears to be a natural phenomenon in chimpanzees lending support to the myriad experimental and observational studies to date.","authors":"Matthew W. Campbell; Cathleen R.

{"abstract":"Nanopores have emerged as helpful research tools for single molecule detection. Through continuum modeling, we investigated the effects of membrane thickness, nanopore size, and pore shape on current signal characteristics of DNA. The simulation results showed that, when reducing the pore diameter, the amplitudes of current signals of DNA increase. Moreover, we found that, compared to cylindrically shaped nanopores, conical-shaped nanopores produce greater signal amplitudes from biomolecules translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that continuum model simulations for the discrimination of DNA and RNA yield current characteristics approximately consistent with experimental measurements and that A-T and G-C base pairs can be distinguished using thin conical solid-state nanopores. Our study not only suggests that computational approaches in this work can be used to guide the designs of nanopore for single molecule detection, but it also provides several possible ways to improve the current amplitudes of nanopores for better resolution.","authors":"Bin Tu; Shiyang Bai; Benzhuo Lu; Qiaojun Fang","keywords":"Computational biology and bioinformatics; Computational biophysics","organization_affiliated":"CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, beijing, China; Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, beijing, China; Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Ambient Particles Health Effects and Prevention Techniques, beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research, Beijing, China","title":"Conic shapes have higher sensitivity than cylindrical ones in nanopore DNA sequencing","id":"652d9676-c316-44d6-a1ca-acc79f6021d3"}
{"abstract":"MLC901, a traditional Chinese medicine containing a cocktail of active molecules, both reduces cerebral infarction and improves recovery in patients with ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and long-term benefits of MLC901 in ischemic and reperfused mouse hearts. Ex vivo, under physiological conditions, MLC901 did not show any modification in heart rate and contraction amplitude. However, upon an ischemic insult, MLC901 administration during reperfusion, improved coronary flow in perfused hearts. In vivo, MLC901 (4 µg/kg) intravenous injection 5 minutes before reperfusion provided a decrease in both infarct size (49.8%) and apoptosis (49.9%) after 1 hour of reperfusion. Akt and ERK1/2 survival pathways were significantly activated in the myocardium of those mice. In the 4-month clinical follow-up upon an additional continuous per os administration, MLC901 treatment decreased cardiac injury as revealed by a 45%-decrease in cTnI plasmatic concentrations and an improved cardiac performance assessed by echocardiography. A histological analysis revealed a 64%-decreased residual scar fibrosis and a 44%-increased vascular density in the infarct region. This paper demonstrates that MLC901 treatment was able to provide acute and long-term cardioprotective effects in a murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo.","authors":"Anne Vincent; Aurélie Covinhes; Christian Barrère; Laura Gallot; Soulit Thoumala; Christophe Piot; Catherine Heurteaux; Michel Lazdunski; Joël Nargeot; Stéphanie Barrère-Lemaire","keywords":"Myocardial infarction; Translational research","organization_affiliated":"IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; Département de cardiologie interventionnelle, Clinique du Millénaire, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IPMC, UMR CNRS 7275, Univ Côte d’Azur, Valbonne, France; IPMC, UMR CNRS 7275, Univ Côte d’Azur, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France; IGF, CNRS, INSERM, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Laboratory of Excellence Ion Channel Science and Therapeutics, Valbonne, France","title":"Acute and long-term cardioprotective effects of the Traditional Chinese Medicine MLC901 against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice","id":"4e6395bd-5598-4fc2-bc28-825ab34fdf8a"}
{"abstract":"Antibody class switch recombination (CSR) in B lymphocytes replaces immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (Igh) Cμ constant region exons (CHs) with one of six CHs lying 100–200 kb downstream1. Each CH is flanked upstream by an I promoter and long repetitive switch (S) region1. Cytokines and activators induce activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)2 and I-promoter transcription, with 3′ IgH regulatory region (3′ IgHRR) enhancers controlling the latter via I-promoter competition for long-range 3′ IgHRR interactions3–8. Transcription through donor Sμ and an activated downstream acceptor S-region targets AID-generated deamination lesions at, potentially, any of hundreds of individual S-region deamination motifs9–11. General DNA repair pathways convert these lesions to double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and join an Sμ-upstream DSB-end to an acceptor S-region-downstream DSB-end for deletional CSR12. AID-initiated DSBs at targets spread across activated S regions routinely participate in such deletional CSR joining11. Here we report that chromatin loop extrusion underlies the mechanism11 by which IgH organization in cis promotes deletional CSR. In naive B cells, loop extrusion dynamically juxtaposes 3′ IgHRR enhancers with the 200-kb upstream Sμ to generate a CSR centre (CSRC). In CSR-activated primary B cells, I-promoter transcription activates cohesin loading, leading to generation of dynamic subdomains that directionally align a downstream S region with Sμ for deletional CSR. During constitutive Sα CSR in CH12F3 B lymphoma cells, inversional CSR can be activated by insertion of a CTCF-binding element (CBE)-based impediment in the extrusion path. CBE insertion also inactivates upstream S-region CSR and converts adjacent downstream sequences into an ectopic S region by inhibiting and promoting their dynamic alignment with Sμ in the CSRC, respectively. Our findings suggest that, in a CSRC, dynamically impeded cohesin-mediated loop extrusion juxtaposes proper ends of AID-initiated donor and acceptor S-region DSBs for deletional CSR. Such a mechanism might also contribute to pathogenic DSB joining genome-wide. Chromatin loop extrusion has fundamental mechanistic roles in immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination.","authors":"Xuefei Zhang; Yu Zhang; Zhaoqing Ba; Nia Kyritsis; Rafael Casellas; Frederick W.

{"abstract":"Individuals at high risk of developing seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be identified for translational research and disease prevention studies through the presence of highly informative and predictive patterns of RA-related autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), in the serum. In serologically positive individuals without arthritis, designated ACPA positive at risk, the presence of mucosal inflammatory processes associated with the presence of local ACPA production has been demonstrated. In other at-risk populations, local RA-related autoantibody production is present even in the absence of serum autoantibodies. Additionally, a proportion of at-risk individuals exhibit local mucosal ACPA production in the lung, as well as radiographic small-airway disease, sputum hypercellularity and increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Other mucosal sites in at-risk individuals also exhibit autoantibody production, inflammation and/or evidence of dysbiosis. As the proportion of individuals who exhibit such localized inflammation-associated ACPA production is substantially higher than the likelihood of an individual developing future RA, this finding raises the hypothesis that mucosal ACPAs have biologically relevant protective roles. Identifying the mechanisms that drive both the generation and loss of externally focused mucosal ACPA production and promote systemic autoantibody expression and ultimately arthritis development should provide insights into new therapeutic approaches to prevent RA. Preclinical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the presence of RA-related autoantibodies in the serum in the absence of clinical symptoms. This Review discusses the relationships during this period between mucosal alterations and the initiation of local and systemic anti-citrullinated protein antibody production. ","authors":"V.

{"abstract":"Humans and other walking bipeds often encounter and compensate for uneven terrain. They might, for example, regulate the body’s momentum when stepping on stones to cross a stream. We examined what to do and how far to look, as a simple optimal control problem, where forward momentum is controlled to compensate for a step change in terrain height, and steady gait regained with no loss of time relative to nominal walking. We modeled planar, human-like walking with pendulum-like legs, and found the most economical control to be quite stereotypical. It starts by gaining momentum several footfalls ahead of an upward step, in anticipation of the momentum lost atop that step, and then ends with another speed-up to regain momentum thereafter. A similar pattern can be scaled to a variety of conditions, including both upward or downward steps, yet allow for considerably reduced overall energy and peak power demands, compared to compensation without anticipation. We define a “persistence time” metric from the transient decay response after a disturbance, to describe how momentum is retained between steps, and how far ahead a disturbance should be planned for. Anticipatory control of momentum can help to economically negotiate uneven terrain.","authors":"Osman Darici; Hakan Temeltas; Arthur D.

{"abstract":"SETD2, an epigenetic tumor suppressor, is frequently mutated in MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemia and relapsed acute leukemia (AL). To clarify the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in MLLr leukemia, two loss-of-function (LOF) Setd2-mutant alleles (Setd2F2478L/WT or Setd2Ex6-KO/WT) were generated and introduced, respectively, to the Mll-Af9 knock-in leukemia mouse model. Both alleles cooperated with Mll-Af9 to accelerate leukemia development that resulted in resistance to standard Cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells showed downregulated signaling related to cell cycle progression, S, and G2/M checkpoint regulation. Thus, after Cytarabine treatment, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells exit from the S phase and progress to the G2/M phase. Importantly, S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint inhibition could resensitize the Mll-Af9/Setd2 double-mutant cells to standard chemotherapy by causing DNA replication collapse, mitotic catastrophe, and increased cell death. These findings demonstrate that LOF SETD2 mutations confer chemoresistance on AL to DNA-damaging treatment by S and G2/M checkpoint defects. The combination of S and G2/M checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy can be explored as a promising therapeutic strategy by exploiting their unique vulnerability and resensitizing chemoresistant AL with SETD2 or SETD2-like epigenetic mutations.","authors":"Yunzhu Dong; Xinghui Zhao; Xiaomin Feng; Yile Zhou; Xiaomei Yan; Ya Zhang; Jiachen Bu; Di Zhan; Yoshihiro Hayashi; Yue Zhang; Zefeng Xu; Rui Huang; Jieyu Wang; Taoran Zhao; Zhijian Xiao; Zhenyu Ju; Paul R.

{"abstract":"Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) systems structure suspension flow in so called flow lanes. The width of these flow lanes is crucial for separation of particles and determines whether particles with certain size are displaced or not. In previous research, separation was observed in simplified DLD systems that did not meet the established DLD geometric design criteria, by adjusting the outflow conditions. We here investigated why these simplified DLD systems are able to displace particles, by experimentally investigating the hydrodynamics in the device. Flow lanes were visualized and the local flow velocities were measured using µPIV and compared with 2D fluid dynamics simulations. The size of the flow lanes strongly correlates with the local flow velocity (Vy and Vx), which depends on the hydrodynamics. Therefore, the geometric design criteria of DLD devices is in fact just one method to control the local hydrodynamics, which may also be influenced by other means. These findings give a new perspective on the separation principle, which makes the technique more flexible and easier to translate to industrial scale.","authors":"J. P. Dijkshoorn; J.

{"abstract":"Many diseases, including cancer, have been associated with impaired regulation of angiogenesis, of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a key regulator. Here, we test the contribution of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) to VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Ndrg1−/− mice exhibit impaired VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in corneas. Tumor angiogenesis induced by cancer cells that express high levels of VEGF-A was also reduced in a mouse dorsal air sac assay. Furthermore, NDRG1 deficiency in ECs prevented angiogenic sprouting from the aorta and the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and ERK1/2 by VEGF-A without affecting the expression and function of VEGFR2. Finally, we show that NDRG1 formed a complex with PLCγ1 through its phosphorylation sites, and the inhibition of PLCγ1 dramatically suppressed VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in the mouse cornea, suggesting an essential role of NDRG1 in VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis through PLCγ1 signaling. Kosuke Watari et al. show that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) stimulates new blood vessel formation that is induced by VEGF-A, using Ndrg1 knockout mice. They find that PLCγ1/ERK signaling mediates this regulation, providing mechanistic insights into how vascular endothelial cells form new vessels.","authors":"Kosuke Watari; Tomohiro Shibata; Hideaki Fujita; Ai Shinoda; Yuichi Murakami; Hideyuki Abe; Akihiko Kawahara; Hiroshi Ito; Jun Akiba; Shigeo Yoshida; Michihiko Kuwano; Mayumi Ono","keywords":"Angiogenesis; Calcium signalling; Growth factor signalling","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Sasebo, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Cancer Translational Research Center, St. Mary’s Institute of Health Sciences, Kurume, Japan; Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kurume University Hospital, Kurume, Japan; Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kurume University Hospital, Kurume, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan; Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kurume University Hospital, Kurume, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan; Cancer Translational Research Center, St. Mary’s Institute of Health Sciences, Kurume, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Oncology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","title":"NDRG1 activates VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis through PLCγ1/ERK signaling in mouse vascular endothelial cells","id":"224d24e2-3b06-4d03-a2ec-9ab107a8773e"}

We evaluated the influence of centrally mediated symptoms on functional outcomes of carpal tunnel release (CTR). A total of 120 patients with surgically treated CTS were enrolled. Centrally mediated symptoms were preoperatively measured by administering a self-reported central sensitization inventory (CSI) questionnaire and peripheral sensitization was measured by assessing patient’s pressure pain thresholds (PPT) in the forearm. Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaires (BCTQ) were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 and 12 months. CSI scores slightly correlated with symptom duration and moderately correlated with preoperative BCTQ scores, while PPT slightly correlated with the BCTQ scores. At 3 months, BCTQ symptom and function scores moderately correlated with lower PPTs and higher CSI scores. At 12 months, only severe electrophysiological grade was associated with BCTQ function scores. Multivariable analysis revealed that preoperative PPT, CSI, and female gender were associated with BCTQ scores at 3 months; these factors failed to be associated for 12-month outcomes. Centrally mediated symptoms measured by CSI and peripheral sensitization measured by PPTs correlated with symptom severity and duration. They were associated with poorer functional outcomes after CTR up to 3 months.

{"abstract":"Human Ebp1 is a member of the proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) family and plays an important role in cancer regulation. Ebp1 shares the methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) fold and binds to mature 80S ribosomes for translational control. Here, we present a cryo-EM single particle analysis reconstruction of Ebp1 bound to non-translating human 80S ribosomes at a resolution range from 3.3 to ~8 Å. Ebp1 blocks the tunnel exit with major interactions to the general uL23/uL29 docking site for nascent chain-associated factors complemented by eukaryote-specific eL19 and rRNA helix H59. H59 is defined as dynamic adaptor undergoing significant remodeling upon Ebp1 binding. Ebp1 recruits rRNA expansion segment ES27L to the tunnel exit via specific interactions with rRNA consensus sequences. The Ebp1-ribosome complex serves as a template for MetAP binding and provides insights into the structural principles for spatial coordination of co-translational events and molecular triage at the ribosomal tunnel exit. The ErbB3 receptor binding protein Ebp1 binds to ribosomes and is linked to translational control. Here, the authors present the cryo-EM structure of human Ebp1 bound to a non-translating 80S ribosome and find that Ebp1 blocks the tunnel exit and recruits the rRNA expansion segment ES27L to the tunnel exit.","authors":"Klemens Wild; Milan Aleksić; Karine Lapouge; Keven D.

{"abstract":"Antarctic have been suggested as an attractive source for antibiotics discovery and members of Streptomyces genus have historically been studied as natural producers of antimicrobial metabolites. Nonetheless, our knowledge on antibiotic-producing Streptomyces from Antarctic is very limited. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of organic extracts from Antarctic Streptomyces strains was evaluated by disk diffusion assays and minimum inhibitory concentration. The strain Streptomyces sp. So13.3 showed the greatest antibiotic activity (MIC = 15.6 μg/mL) against Gram-positive bacteria and growth reduction of Gram‒negative pathogens. The bioactive fraction in the crude extract was revealed by TLC‒bioautography at Rf = 0.78 with molecular weight between 148 and 624 m/z detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The strain So13.3 was taxonomically affiliated as Streptomyces fildesensis. Whole genome sequencing and analysis suggested a 9.47 Mb genome size with 42 predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and 56 putative clusters representing a 22% of total genome content. Interestingly, a large number of them (11 of 42 BGCs and 40 of 56 putative BGCs), did not show similarities with other known BGCs. Our results highlight the potential of the Antarctic Streptomyces strains as a promising source of novel antimicrobials, particularly the strain Streptomyces fildesensis So13.3, which first draft genome is reported in this work.","authors":"Kattia Núñez-Montero; Claudio Lamilla; Michel Abanto; Fumito Maruyama; Milko A.

{"abstract":"Metastasis underlies the majority of cancer-related deaths yet remains poorly understood due, in part, to the lack of models in vivo. Here we show that expression of the EMT master inducer Snail in primary adult Drosophila intestinal tumors leads to the dissemination of tumor cells and formation of macrometastases. Snail drives an EMT in tumor cells, which, although retaining some epithelial markers, subsequently break through the basal lamina of the midgut, undergo a collective migration and seed polyclonal metastases. While metastases re-epithelialize over time, we found that early metastases are remarkably mesenchymal, discarding the requirement for a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition for early stages of metastatic growth. Our results demonstrate the formation of metastases in adult flies, and identify a key role for partial-EMTs in driving it. This model opens the door to investigate the basic mechanisms underlying metastasis, in a powerful in vivo system suited for rapid genetic and drug screens. Modelling and visualizing tumor metastasis in Drosophila has been a challenge. Here, the authors show that constitutive expression of Sna in primary adult Drosophila intestinal tumors drives EMT and dissemination of tumor cells, induces collective cell migration and formation of polyclonal metastases.","authors":"Kyra Campbell; Fabrizio Rossi; Jamie Adams; Ioanna Pitsidianaki; Francisco M.

{"abstract":"Cancer-causing genome instability is a major concern during space travel due to exposure of astronauts to potent sources of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1+/− mouse model to study the effects high-LET 56Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1+/− mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with 56Fe ions compared to γ-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.","authors":"Rutulkumar Patel; Luchang Zhang; Amar Desai; Mark J.

{"abstract":"Quasiperiodic systems are aperiodic but deterministic, so their critical behavior differs from that of clean systems and disordered ones as well. Quasiperiodic criticality was previously understood only in the special limit where the couplings follow discrete quasiperiodic sequences. Here we consider generic quasiperiodic modulations; we find, remarkably, that for a wide class of spin chains, generic quasiperiodic modulations flow to discrete sequences under a real-space renormalization-group transformation. These discrete sequences are therefore fixed points of a functional renormalization group. This observation allows for an asymptotically exact treatment of the critical points. We use this approach to analyze the quasiperiodic Heisenberg, Ising, and Potts spin chains, as well as a phenomenological model for the quasiperiodic many-body localization transition. Quasiperiodic systems share features with disordered models but their underlying determinism give them distinct behaviour. Here the authors study the critical behaviour of quasiperiodic spin models and show that the renormalization group fixed points have couplings given by self-similar discrete sequences.","authors":"Utkarsh Agrawal; Sarang Gopalakrishnan; Romain Vasseur","keywords":"Phase transitions and critical phenomena; Statistical physics, thermodynamics and nonlinear dynamics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Physics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA; Department of Physics and Astronomy, CUNY College of Staten Island, Staten Island, USA; Physics Program and Initiative for the Theoretical Sciences, The Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, USA; Department of Physics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA","title":"Universality and quantum criticality in quasiperiodic spin chains","id":"ece7fc9d-1bb6-427e-a90d-4184e5864861"}

In this paper, the downstream gene network of CD14-TNF-EGFR pathway in leishmaniasis, a tropical disease, is reconstructed. Network analysis showed that NFkB links the signaling and gene network, used as a point of intervention through a synthetic circuit embedded within the negative autoregulatory feedback loop. A chimeric protein kinase C (PKC) is incorporated in the synthetic circuit, under the transcriptional regulation of Lac repressor and IPTG, as an inducer. The chimeric PKC_ζα via IκKb phosphorylation activates NFκB, and modulates the gene expression from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory phenotype in in vitro L. major infected macrophage model.

{"abstract":"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiate during postnatal development into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, in a process distinguished by substantial changes in morphology and the onset of myelin gene expression. A mammalian-specific CNS myelin gene, tmem10, also called Opalin, encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein that is highly upregulated during early stages of OPC differentiation; however, a function for TMEM10 has not yet been identified. Here, consistent with previous studies, we detect TMEM10 protein in mouse brain beginning at ~P10 and show that protein levels continue to increase as oligodendrocytes differentiate and myelinate axons in vivo. We show that constitutive TMEM10 overexpression in the Oli-neu oligodendroglial cell line promotes the expression of the myelin-associated genes MAG, CNP and CGT, whereas TMEM10 knock down in primary OPCs reduces CNP mRNA expression and decreases the percentage of MBP-positive oligodendrocytes that differentiate in vitro. Ectopic TMEM10 expression evokes an increase in process extension and branching, and blocking endogenous TMEM10 expression results in oligodendrocytes with abnormal cell morphology. These findings may have implications for human demyelinating disorders, as oligodendrocytes expressing TMEM10 are detected in human remyelinating multiple sclerosis lesions. Together, our findings provide evidence that TMEM10 promotes oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation and may represent a novel target to promote remyelination in demyelinating disorders.","authors":"Omar de Faria; Ajit S.

{"abstract":"Uncovering grain-scale mechanisms that underlie the disorder–order transition in assemblies of dissipative, athermal particles is a fundamental problem with technological relevance. To date, the study of granular crystallization has mainly focussed on the symmetry of crystalline patterns while their emergence and growth from irregular clusters of grains remains largely unexplored. Here crystallization of three-dimensional packings of frictional spheres is studied at the grain-scale using X-ray tomography and persistent homology. The latter produces a map of the topological configurations of grains within static partially crystallized packings. Using numerical simulations, we show that similar maps are measured dynamically during the melting of a perfect crystal. This map encodes new information on the formation process of tetrahedral and octahedral pores, the building blocks of perfect crystals. Four key formation mechanisms of these pores reproduce the main changes of the map during crystallization and provide continuous deformation pathways representative of the crystallization dynamics. Emergence and growth of crystalline domains in granular media remains under-explored. Here, the authors analyse tomographic snapshots from partially recrystallized packings of spheres using persistent homology and find agreement with proposed transitions based on continuous deformation of octahedral and tetrahedral voids.","authors":"M.

{"abstract":"Relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) entails a poor prognosis. Treating these cases is challenging due to lack of effective therapies and, in some cases, poor performance status and/or presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), among others. No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has ever been conducted comparing a second allo-HCT against other treatments. Existing data are mainly from observational studies or registries. Success of a second allo-HCT is dependent on appropriately selecting patients who might achieve best outcomes with reasonable non-relapse mortality (NRM) risk. Several factors are associated with worse outcomes, namely a shorter time from first allo-HCT to relapse or to the second allo-HCT, and AML not being in complete hematologic remission (CR). Patients relapsing earlier than 6 months or having active/persistent disease should be enrolled in clinical trials. Limitations of the published literature include retrospective small size studies, a heterogeneous population, and absence of information on somatic mutations, among others. Future studies assessing the role of a second allo-HCT should evaluate the impact of IDH1, IDH2, or others on outcomes; and the feasibility and efficacy of targeted therapies in the pre-, peri-, or post-second allo-HCT setting.","authors":"Nour M.

{"abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate FRET-based multicolor lasing within chemically open droplet cavities that allow online modulation of the gain medium composition. To do this, we generated monodisperse microfluidic droplets loaded with coumarin 102 (donor), where the spherical droplets acted as whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical cavities in which coumarin 102 lasing (~ 470 nm) was observed. The lasing color was switched from blue to orange by the introduction of a second dye (acceptor, rhodamine 6 G) into the flowing droplet cavities; subsequent lasing from rhodamine 6 G (~ 590 nm) was observed together with the complete absence of coumarin 102 emission. The ability to control color switching online within the same droplet cavity enables sequential detection of multiple target molecules within or around the cavity. As a demonstration of this concept, we show how the presence of FITC-Dextran and methylene blue (MB) in the medium surrounding the lasing droplets can be sequentially detected by the blue and orange laser respectively. The method is simple and can be extended to a range of water-soluble dyes, thus enabling a wide spectral range for the lasing with the use of a single pump laser source.","authors":"Lu Zheng; Min Zhi; Yinthai Chan; Saif A.

A major challenge is to determine the relationships between these oscillatory activities and the identified networks of sleep-promoting and wake-promoting neurons distributed throughout the brain. Improved understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that orchestrate sleep-related oscillatory activities, both in time and space, is expected to generate further insight into the delineation of sleep states and their functions. The complex spatiotemporal organization and regulation of sleep-related brain activity has been appreciated only in the past decade.

{"abstract":"Dactylitis is diffuse swelling of the digits that is usually related to an underlying inflammatory or infiltrative disorder. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is the most common severe disease thought to cause dactylitis. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of PsA-related dactylitis comes from experimental animal models of PsA-like disease, as well as advances in imaging and other clinical studies. Clinical trials in PsA have increasingly included dactylitis as an important secondary outcome measure. These studies indicate that cytokines drive multi-locus microanatomical pan-digital pathology. Given the importance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the pathogenesis of dactylitis is best understood as an initial aberrant innate immune response to biomechanical stress or injury, with subsequent adaptive immune mechanisms amplifying the dactylitis inflammatory response. Regarding the treatment of dactylitis, no studies have been conducted using dactylitis as the primary outcome measure, and the current knowledge comes from analysis of dactylitis as a secondary outcome measure. Dactylitis is diffuse inflammation of the digits and is so closely associated with psoriatic arthritis that it can be used as an outcome measure of it. In this Opinion article, the authors describe how imaging modalities and scoring systems combined with data from animal models can be used to understand the underlying anatomy and immunopathogenesis of dactylitis.","authors":"Dennis McGonagle; Ai Lyn Tan; Abdulla Watad; Philip Helliwell","keywords":"Immunopathogenesis; Ligaments; Psoriatic arthritis; Tendons","organization_affiliated":"NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds, UK; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds, UK; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Department of Medicine ‘B’, Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Rheumatology department, Bradford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bradford, UK","title":"Pathophysiology, assessment and treatment of psoriatic dactylitis","id":"3591bf9c-dec7-427c-a699-60ffe2958472"}
{"abstract":"In amniotes, the development of the primitive streak and its accompanying ‘organizer’ define the first stages of gastrulation. Although these structures have been characterized in detail in model organisms, the human primitive streak and organizer remain a mystery. When stimulated with BMP4, micropatterned colonies of human embryonic stem cells self-organize to generate early embryonic germ layers1. Here we show that, in the same type of colonies, Wnt signalling is sufficient to induce a primitive streak, and stimulation with Wnt and Activin is sufficient to induce an organizer, as characterized by embryo-like sharp boundary formation, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expression of the organizer-specific transcription factor GSC. Moreover, when grafted into chick embryos, human stem cell colonies treated with Wnt and Activin induce and contribute autonomously to a secondary axis while inducing a neural fate in the host. This fulfils the most stringent functional criteria for an organizer, and its discovery represents a milestone in human embryology. Stimulation of Wnt and Nodal pathways in micropatterned human embryonic stem cell colonies induce these colonies to exhibit characteristic spatial expression patterns of the organizer and reproduce organizer function when grafted into a host embryo.","authors":"I.

{"abstract":"Atmospheric pressure cold plasma (ACP) is introduced as a useful tool in a variety of biological applications. Proteins are the most abundant macromolecules in living systems with a central role in all biological processes. These organic molecules are modified by ACP exposure that is responsible for many of ACP’s biological effects. This study evaluated the effect of ACP on the production of recombinant phytase in yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) as well as the structure and function of the phytase enzyme. The results indicated that yeast cells treated with ACP, directly or indirectly, produced higher amounts of recombinant phytase, which was associated with the time of ACP treatment. The exposure of commercial phytase solution with ACP caused a significant increase in the enzyme activity (125%) after 4 hours. Evaluation of the phytase solution by far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence analysis indicated that this protein maintained its secondary structure when exposed to ACP while the tertiary structure was slightly unfolded. The effects of heat and H2O2 on the phytase structure and function were compared with the effect of ACP treatment. The modification of Cys, Tyr and Trp amino acids upon reactive oxygen/nitrogen spices was simulated using a molecular dynamics approach. RMSF and RMSD analysis suggested that this structural alteration occurs owing to changes made by reactive species in accessible amino acids.","authors":"Mahsa Farasat; Sareh Arjmand; Seyed Omid Ranaei Siadat; Yahya Sefidbakht; Hamid Ghomi","keywords":"Biophysics; Optics and photonics","organization_affiliated":"Laser and Plasma research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.

{"abstract":"Epithelial barrier function is maintained by coordination of cell proliferation and cell loss, whereas barrier dysfunction can lead to disease and organismal death. JNK signalling is a conserved stress signalling pathway activated by bacterial infection and tissue damage, often leading to apoptotic cell death and compensatory cell proliferation. Here we show that the stress inducible transcription factor ATF3 restricts JNK activity in the Drosophila midgut. ATF3 regulates JNK-dependent apoptosis and regeneration through the transcriptional regulation of the JNK antagonist, Raw. Enterocyte-specific ATF3 inactivation increases JNK activity and sensitivity to infection, a phenotype that can be rescued by Raw overexpression or JNK suppression. ATF3 depletion enhances intestinal regeneration triggered by infection, but does not compensate for the loss of enterocytes and ATF3-depleted flies succumb to infection due to intestinal barrier dysfunction. In sum, we provide a mechanism to explain how an ATF3-Raw module controls JNK signalling to maintain normal intestinal barrier function during acute infection. Stress response JNK signalling is important for cell death-induced regeneration. Here the authors show in adultDrosophilaenterocytes that ATF3 regulates the expression of Raw, a JNK antagonist, to control intestinal regeneration and barrier function in response to infection.","authors":"Jun Zhou; Bruce A.

{"abstract":"We characterized the spatiotemporal epidemiology of rabies from January 2009 through March 2014 across the interface between a wildlife reserve and communal livestock farming area in South Africa. Brain tissue from 344 animals of 28 different species were tested for lyssavirus antigen. Of these, 146 (42.4%) samples tested positive, of which 141 (96.6%) came from dogs. Brain samples of dogs were more likely to test positive for lyssavirus antigen if they were found and destroyed in the reserve, compared to samples originating from dogs outside the reserve (65.3% vs. 45.5%; odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27–4.03), despite rabies surveillance outside the reserve being targeted to dogs that have a higher index of suspicion due to clinical or epidemiological evidence of infection. In the reserve, dogs were more likely to test positive for rabies if they were shot further from villages (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.18–1.71) and closer to water points (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.21–0.81). Our results provide a basis for refinement of existing surveillance and control programs to mitigate the threat of spillover of rabies to wildlife populations.","authors":"Michael Grover; Paul R.

{"abstract":"Understanding vascular development in vertebrates is an important scientific endeavor. Normal vasculatures generally start off as a disorganized capillary lattice which progressively matures into a well-organized vascular loop comprising a hierarchy of arteries and veins. One striking feature of vascular development is the interlacing of arteries and veins. How arteries and veins manage to avoid themselves and interlace with such a perfect architecture is not understood. Here we present a detailed view of the development of the vasculature in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. We find that the origin of arteriovenous interlacing lies in the presence of an increased hemodynamic resistance at the distal part of the arteries due to vascular flattening onto the ectodermal surface. This reduces the vascular conductance distally, thus repelling veins away. In more proximal parts, vessels round off into cylinders and the increased flow attracts veins. Sophie Richard et al. present a detailed study of the development of the vasculature in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane. They find that the interlacing of arteries and veins arises due to differential hemodynamic resistance acting on the distal and proximal ends of the arteries causing veins to be alternately repelled or attracted.","authors":"Sophie Richard; Amanda Brun; Antonio Tedesco; Benjamin Gallois; Naoual Taghi; Philippe Dantan; Johanne Seguin; Vincent Fleury","keywords":"Angiogenesis; Cardiovascular biology; Time-lapse imaging","organization_affiliated":"Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Department of Chemistry, São Paulo University-FFCLRP, Center of Nanotechnology and Tissue Engineering-Photobiology and Photomedicine Research Group, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France; Unité de Technologies Chimiques et Biologiques pour la Santé (UTCBS), Université Paris Descartes/CNRS UMR 8258/Inserm U1022, Paris, France; Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot/CNRS UMR 7057, Paris, France","title":"Direct imaging of capillaries reveals the mechanism of arteriovenous interlacing in the chick chorioallantoic membrane","id":"2d31f41b-6ffa-435b-b07b-ab882bb16b49"}
{"abstract":"Widespread use of gene therapy technologies is limited in part by the lack of small genetic switches with wide dynamic ranges that control transgene expression without the requirement of additional protein components1–5. In this study, we engineered a class of type III hammerhead ribozymes to develop RNA switches that are highly efficient at cis-cleaving mammalian mRNAs and showed that they can be tightly regulated by a steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotide. Our variant ribozymes enabled in vivo regulation of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered transgenes, allowing dose-dependent and up to 223-fold regulation of protein expression over at least 43 weeks. To test the potential of these reversible on-switches in gene therapy for anemia of chronic kidney disease6, we demonstrated regulated expression of physiological levels of erythropoietin with a well-tolerated dose of the inducer oligonucleotide. These small, modular and efficient RNA switches may improve the safety and efficacy of gene therapies and broaden their use. In vivo control of expression levels of AAV-delivered genes is enabled by an engineered RNA switch.","authors":"Guocai Zhong; Haimin Wang; Wenhui He; Yujun Li; Huihui Mou; Zachary J. Tickner; Mai H.

{"abstract":"Telomeres and the insulin/PI3K pathway are considered hallmarks of aging and cancer. Here, we describe a role for PI3K/AKT in the regulation of TRF1, an essential component of the shelterin complex. PI3K and AKT chemical inhibitors reduce TRF1 telomeric foci and lead to increased telomeric DNA damage and fragility. We identify the PI3Kα isoform as responsible for this TRF1 inhibition. TRF1 is phosphorylated at different residues by AKT and these modifications regulate TRF1 protein stability and TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA in vitro and are important for in vivo TRF1 telomere location and cell viability. Patient-derived breast cancer PDX mouse models that effectively respond to a PI3Kα specific inhibitor, BYL719, show decreased TRF1 levels and increased DNA damage. These findings functionally connect two of the major pathways for cancer and aging, telomeres and the PI3K pathway, and pinpoint PI3K and AKT as novel targets for chemical modulation of telomere protection. Regulation of telomeres and the insulin/PI3K pathway both have roles in aging and cancer development but have not been functionally linked. Here the authors demonstrate that PI3K, via downstream targets, regulates TRF1 via phosphorylation.","authors":"Marinela Méndez-Pertuz; Paula Martínez; Carmen Blanco-Aparicio; Elena Gómez-Casero; Ana Belen García; Jorge Martínez-Torrecuadrada; Marta Palafox; Javier Cortés; Violeta Serra; Joaquin Pastor; Maria A.

{"abstract":"Central Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was dominated by polar desert and steppe-tundra biomes. Despite this, a human presence during this time period is evident at several locations across the region, including in Switzerland, less than 50 km from the Alpine ice sheet margin. It has been hypothesised that such human activity may have been restricted to brief periods of climatic warming within the LGM, but chronological information from many of these sites are currently too poorly resolved to corroborate this. Here we present a revised chronology of LGM human occupation in Switzerland. AMS radiocarbon dating of cut-marked reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) bones from the sites of Kastelhöhle-Nord and Y-Höhle indicates human occupation of Switzerland was most likely restricted to between 23,400 and 22,800 cal. BP. This timeframe corresponds to Greenland Interstadial 2, a brief warming phase, supporting the hypothesis that human presence was facilitated by favourable climatic episodes. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotope analysis of the fauna provides palaeoenvironmental information for this time period. These findings contribute to our understanding of human activity in ice-marginal environments and have implications for understanding cultural connections across central Europe during the LGM.","authors":"Hazel Reade; Jennifer A.

In this study we reciprocally transplanted five Leptoria phrygia colonies between two sites with significantly different temperature regimes and monitored them for 12 months. Our ITS2 amplicon deep sequencing demonstrated that L. phrygia acclimatized to maintain a strong and stable association with Durusdinium D17, D. trenchii, and D. glynnii, but also remained flexible and formed a short-term association with different Cladocopium. Most interestingly, two colonies shuffled between Durusdinium and Cladocopium without the occurrence of bleaching; one colony even switched its dominant Cladocopium after generic shuffling. Both dominant Cladocopium were originally rare with relative abundances as low as 0.024%.

{"abstract":"Many complex processes, from protein folding to neuronal network dynamics, can be described as stochastic exploration of a high-dimensional energy landscape. Although efficient algorithms for cluster detection in high-dimensional spaces have been developed over the last two decades, considerably less is known about the reliable inference of state transition dynamics in such settings. Here we introduce a flexible and robust numerical framework to infer Markovian transition networks directly from time-independent data sampled from stationary equilibrium distributions. We demonstrate the practical potential of the inference scheme by reconstructing the network dynamics for several protein-folding transitions, gene-regulatory network motifs, and HIV evolution pathways. The predicted network topologies and relative transition time scales agree well with direct estimates from time-dependent molecular dynamics data, stochastic simulations, and phylogenetic trees, respectively. Owing to its generic structure, the framework introduced here will be applicable to high-throughput RNA and protein-sequencing datasets, and future cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. Reconstructing system dynamics on complex high-dimensional energy landscapes from static experimental snapshots remains challenging. Here, the authors introduce a framework to infer the essential dynamics of physical and biological systems without need for time-dependent measurements.","authors":"Philip Pearce; Francis G.

Advances in optical imaging and statistical analyses of acquired optical signals have yielded various metrics for inferring neural connectivity, and hence for mapping signal intercorrelation. However, a single coefficient is traditionally derived to classify the connection strength between two cells, ignoring the fact that neural systems are inherently time-variant systems. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a time-varying Pearson’s correlation coefficient, spike-sorting, wavelet transform, and wavelet coherence of calcium transients from DIV 12–15 hippocampal neurons from GCaMP6s mice after applying various concentrations of glutamate. Results provide a comprehensive overview of resulting firing patterns, network connectivity, signal directionality, and network properties. Together, these metrics provide a more comprehensive and robust method of analyzing transient neural signals, and enable future investigations for tracking the effects of different stimuli on network properties.","authors":"Carlos Renteria; Yuan-Zhi Liu; Eric J.

{"abstract":"Streptomyces are Gram-positive bacteria of significant industrial importance due to their ability to produce a wide range of antibiotics and bioactive secondary metabolites. Recent advances in genome mining have revealed that Streptomyces genomes possess a large number of unexplored silent secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs). This indicates that Streptomyces genomes continue to be an invaluable source for new drug discovery. Here, we present high-quality genome sequences of 22 Streptomyces species and eight different Streptomyces venezuelae strains assembled by a hybrid strategy exploiting both long-read and short-read genome sequencing methods. The assembled genomes have more than 97.4% gene space completeness and total lengths ranging from 6.7 to 10.1 Mbp. Their annotation identified 7,000 protein coding genes, 20 rRNAs, and 68 tRNAs on average. In silico prediction of smBGCs identified a total of 922 clusters, including many clusters whose products are unknown. We anticipate that the availability of these genomes will accelerate discovery of novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces and elucidate complex smBGC regulation.

{"abstract":"To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (\u003c0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.","authors":"Kazuma Kiyotani; Yujiro Toyoshima; Kensaku Nemoto; Yusuke Nakamura","keywords":"High-throughput screening; Immunogenetics","organization_affiliated":"Project for Immunogenomics, Cancer Precision Medicine Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan; Project for Immunogenomics, Cancer Precision Medicine Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan; Project for Immunogenomics, Cancer Precision Medicine Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan; Project for Immunogenomics, Cancer Precision Medicine Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan","title":"Bioinformatic prediction of potential T cell epitopes for SARS-Cov-2","id":"bd84b789-6ec6-47ae-918b-40b1e0e2949f"}

While the link between scabies and secondary bacterial infections causing post infective complications of Group A streptococcal and staphylococcal pyoderma is increasingly recognized, very little is known about the microbiota of Sarcoptes scabiei.

The majority of adult mite bacterial reads matched with Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria), followed by Corynebacteriaceae (phylum Actinobacteria). Klebsiella was the most dominant genus (78%) and Corynebacterium constituted 9% of the assigned sequences. Scabies mite eggs had a more diverse microbial composition with sequences from Proteobacteria being the most dominant (75%), while Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes accounted for 23% of the egg microbiome sequences. DNA sequences of a potential endosymbiont, namely Streptomyces, were identified in the metagenome sequence data of both life stages. The presence of Streptomyces was confirmed by conventional PCR. Digital droplet PCR indicated higher Streptomyces numbers in adult mites compared to eggs. Streptomyces were localized histologically in the scabies mite gut and faecal pellets by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH).

{"abstract":"Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcolgenides (2D-TMDs) are among the most intriguing materials for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Albeit still at the embryonic stage, building thin films by manipulating and stacking preformed 2D nanosheets is now emerging as a practical and cost-effective bottom-up paradigm to obtain excellent electrical properties over large areas. Herein, we exploit the ultrathin morphology and outstanding solution stability of 2D WS2 colloidal nanocrystals to make thin films of TMDs assembled on a millimetre scale by a layer-by-layer deposition approach. We found that a room-temperature surface treatment with a superacid, performed with the precise scope of removing the native insulating surfactants, promotes in-plane assembly of the colloidal WS2 nanoflakes into stacks parallel to the substrate, along with healing of sulphur vacancies in the lattice that are detrimental to electrical conductivity. The as-obtained 2D WS2 thin films, characterized by a smooth and compact morphology, feature a high planar conductivity of up to 1 μS, comparable to the values reported for epitaxially grown WS2 monolayers, and enable photocurrent generation upon light irradiation over a wide range of visible to near-infrared frequencies.","authors":"Rosanna Mastria; Riccardo Scarfiello; Davide Altamura; Cinzia Giannini; Andrea Liscio; Alessandro Kovtun; Giuseppe Valerio Bianco; Giovanni Bruno; Vincenzo Grillo; Amir H.

{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lysine restriction on inflammatory responses in piglets. 38 male piglets with similar body weight of 9.62 kg were randomly divided into control group (basal diet) and lysine-restricted group (diet containing 70% lysine of the control diet). The results showed that lysine restriction increased the serum concentration of IgG an IgM. Piglets fed the lysine-restricted diet exhibited overexpression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the kidney (P \u003c 0.05) and IL-6 and IL-4 in the spleen (P \u003c 0.05). The mRNA abundances of IL-4 in the kidney (P \u003c 0.05) and IL-10 in the liver (P \u003c 0.05) were significantly lower in the lysine-restricted group compared with the control group. Meanwhile, lysine restriction increased the mRNA level of Tlr8 in the kidney (P \u003c 0.05) but decreased the mRNA level of Tlr8 in the liver (P \u003c 0.05). Finally, lysine restriction markedly enhanced extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in the kidney and liver and nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) was activated in the liver and spleen in response to dietary lysine restriction. In conclusion, lysine restriction affected inflammatory responses in the kidney, liver, and spleen via mediating serum antibody volume, inflammatory cytokines, Tlrs system, and ERK1/2 and NF-κB signals in piglets.","authors":"Hui Han; Jie Yin; Bin Wang; Xingguo Huang; Jiming Yao; Jie Zheng; Wenjun Fan; Tiejun Li; Yulong Yin","keywords":"Interferons; Interleukins; Toll-like receptors; Transforming growth factor beta; Tumour-necrosis factors","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science in South-Central, Ministry of Agriculture; Hunan Provincial Engineering Research Center for Healthy Livestock and Poultry Production, Changsha, P.R.

{"abstract":"Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a ubiquitously expressed cytokine with functions beyond the immune system. In several diseases, the induction of TNF expression in resistance artery smooth muscle cells enhances microvascular myogenic vasoconstriction and perturbs blood flow. This pathological role prompted our hypothesis that constitutively expressed TNF regulates myogenic signalling and systemic haemodynamics under non-pathological settings. Here we show that acutely deleting the TNF gene in smooth muscle cells or pharmacologically scavenging TNF with etanercept (ETN) reduces blood pressure and resistance artery myogenic responsiveness; the latter effect is conserved across five species, including humans. Changes in transmural pressure are transduced into intracellular signals by membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) that connect to a canonical myogenic signalling pathway. Our data positions mTNF ‘reverse signalling’ as an integral element of a microvascular mechanosensor; pathologic or therapeutic perturbations of TNF signalling, therefore, necessarily affect microvascular tone and systemic haemodynamics. TNF is typically viewed as an inflammatory mediator. Here the authors identify a non-inflammatory mechanism conserved across species whereby the constitutively expressed smooth muscle cell TNF mediates myogenic signal transduction in skeletal muscle resistance arteries and regulates mean arterial blood pressure.","authors":"Jeffrey T.

{"abstract":"Improving efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy remains challenging due to difficulty increasing specificity and immune responses against cancer and limited understanding of its population dynamics. Here, we construct programmable and modular synthetic gene circuits to control adenoviral replication and release of immune effectors selectively in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in response to multiple promoter and microRNA inputs. By performing mouse model experiments and computational simulations, we find that replicable adenovirus has a superior tumor-killing efficacy than non-replicable adenovirus. We observe a synergistic effect on promoting local lymphocyte cytotoxicity and systematic vaccination in immunocompetent mouse models by combining tumor lysis and secretion of immunomodulators. Furthermore, our computational simulations show that oncolytic virus which encodes immunomodulators can exert a more robust therapeutic efficacy than combinatorial treatment with oncolytic virus and immune effector. Our results provide an effective strategy to engineer oncolytic adenovirus, which may lead to innovative immunotherapies for a variety of cancers. It is difficult to improve the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy due to immune system responses and limited understanding of population dynamics. Here the authors use synthetic biology gene circuits to control adenoviral replication and release of immunomodulators in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.","authors":"Huiya Huang; Yiqi Liu; Weixi Liao; Yubing Cao; Qiang Liu; Yakun Guo; Yinying Lu; Zhen Xie","keywords":"Cancer immunotherapy; Genetic circuit engineering; Synthetic biology","organization_affiliated":"MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Division, Center for Synthetic and System Biology, Department of Automation, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Syngentech Inc., Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Division, Center for Synthetic and System Biology, Department of Automation, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Syngentech Inc., Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, China; Syngentech Inc., Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, China; Syngentech Inc., Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, China; The comprehensive Liver cancer center, The 5th medical center of PLA Genaral Hospital, Beijing, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Division, Center for Synthetic and System Biology, Department of Automation, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","title":"Oncolytic adenovirus programmed by synthetic gene circuit for cancer immunotherapy","id":"444aa4b3-e1de-440a-9901-6f6db6177f0f"}
{"abstract":" Seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors are a vast group of proteins that respond to various cues and transmit signals intracellularly by interacting with heterotrimeric G proteins, arrestins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Recent structural analyses reveal common means of interaction between 7TM receptors and these intracellular signalling components. A revolution in the analysis of seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors has provided detailed information about how these physiologically important signalling proteins interact with extracellular cues. However, it has proved much more challenging to understand how 7TM receptors convey information to their principal intracellular targets: heterotrimeric G proteins, G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins. Recent structures now suggest a common mechanism that enables these structurally diverse cytoplasmic proteins to 'hitch a ride' on hundreds of different activated 7TM receptors in order to instigate physiological change.","authors":"John J.

{"abstract":"Metalenses have shown a number of promising functionalities that are comparable with conventional refractive lenses. However, current metalenses are still far from commercialization due to the formidable fabrication costs. Here, we demonstrate a low-cost dielectric metalens that works in the visible spectrum. The material of the metalens consists of a matrix-inclusion composite in which a hierarchy satisfies two requirements for the single-step fabrication; a high refractive index and a pattern-transfer capability. We use a UV-curable resin as a matrix to enable direct pattern replication by the composite, and titanium dioxide nanoparticles as inclusions to increase the refractive index of the composite. Therefore, such a dielectric metalens can be fabricated with a single step of UV nanoimprint lithography. An experimental demonstration of the nanoparticle composite-based metalens validates the feasibility of our approach and capability for future applications. Our method allows rapid replication of metalenses repeatedly and thereby provides an advance toward the use of metalenses on a commercial scale. Current metalenses are far from commercialization due to fabrication cost and low throughput. Here, the authors use a UV-curable resin as a matrix for direct pattern replication by the composite and TiO2 nanoparticles to increase the refractive index of the composite, allowing dielectric metalenses to be manufactured in a single step.","authors":"Gwanho Yoon; Kwan Kim; Daihong Huh; Heon Lee; Junsuk Rho","keywords":"Design, synthesis and processing; Metamaterials; Nanophotonics and plasmonics; Surface patterning","organization_affiliated":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; National Institute of Nanomaterials Technology (NINT), Pohang, Republic of Korea","title":"Single-step manufacturing of hierarchical dielectric metalens in the visible","id":"228d4b9b-a67e-43a9-8500-10b57674f06a"}
{"abstract":"Distillers grains are co-products of the corn ethanol industry widely used in animal feed. We examined the effects of erythromycin, penicillin, and virginiamycin at low concentrations reflective of those detected in distillers grains on bacterial resistance selection. At 0.1 µg/ml erythromycin, macrolide-resistant mutants were induced in one Campylobacter coli and one Enterococcus faecium strain, while these strains plus three additional C. coli, one additional E. faecium, and one C. jejuni also developed resistance when exposed to 0.25 µg/ml erythromycin. At 0.5 µg/ml erythromycin, a total of eight strains (four Campylobacter and four Enterococcus) obtained macrolide-resistant mutants, including two strains from each genus that were not selected at lower erythromycin concentrations. For penicillin, three of five E. faecium strains but none of five Enterococcus faecalis strains consistently developed resistance at all three selection concentrations. Virginiamycin at two M1:S1 ratios did not induce resistance development in four out of five E. faecium strains; however, increased resistance was observed in the fifth one under 0.25 and 0.5 µg/ml virginiamycin selections. Although not yet tested in vivo, these findings suggest a potential risk of stimulating bacterial resistance development in the animal gut when distillers grains containing certain antibiotic residues are used in animal feed.","authors":"Beilei Ge; Kelly J.

{"abstract":"Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamus play a key role in regulating food intake and body weight, by releasing three different orexigenic molecules: AgRP; GABA; and neuropeptide Y. AgRP neurons express various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with different coupling properties, including Gs-linked GPCRs. At present, the potential role of Gs-coupled GPCRs in regulating the activity of AgRP neurons remains unknown. Here we show that the activation of Gs-coupled receptors expressed by AgRP neurons leads to a robust and sustained increase in food intake. We also provide detailed mechanistic data linking the stimulation of this class of receptors to the observed feeding phenotype. Moreover, we show that this pathway is clearly distinct from other GPCR signalling cascades that are operative in AgRP neurons. Our data suggest that drugs able to inhibit this signalling pathway may become useful for the treatment of obesity. Hypothalamic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons play a key role in regulating food intake. Here, the authors report a novel pathway in which activation of Gs-coupled receptors on AgRP neurons leads to robust, sustained increase in food intake.

{"abstract":"Obesity and its numerous adverse health consequences have taken on global, pandemic proportions. White adipose tissue (WAT) – a key contributor in many metabolic diseases – contributes about one fourth of a healthy human’s body mass. Despite its significance, many WAT-related pathophysiogical mechanisms in humans are still not understood, largely due to the reliance on non-human animal models. In recent years, Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) platforms have developed into promising alternatives for animal models; these systems integrate engineered human tissues into physiological microenvironment supplied by a vasculature-like microfluidic perfusion. Here, we report the development of a novel OoC that integrates functional mature human white adipocytes. The WAT-on-a-chip is a multilayer device that features tissue chambers tailored specifically for the maintenance of 3D tissues based on human primary adipocytes, with supporting nourishment provided through perfused media channels. The platform’s capability to maintain long-term viability and functionality of white adipocytes was confirmed by real-time monitoring of fatty acid uptake, by quantification of metabolite release into the effluent media as well as by an intact responsiveness to a therapeutic compound. The novel system provides a promising tool for wide-ranging applications in mechanistic research of WAT-related biology, in studying of pathophysiological mechanisms in obesity and diabetes, and in R\u0026D of pharmaceutical industry.","authors":"Julia Rogal; Carina Binder; Elena Kromidas; Julia Roosz; Christopher Probst; Stefan Schneider; Katja Schenke-Layland; Peter Loskill","keywords":"Biological models; Diabetes; Lab-on-a-chip; Obesity; Tissue engineering","organization_affiliated":"Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Department of Women’s Health, Research Institute for Women’s Health, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Department of Women’s Health, Research Institute for Women’s Health, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB, Stuttgart, Germany; Department of Women’s Health, Research Institute for Women’s Health, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany; NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tübingen, Reutlingen, Germany; Department of Medicine/Cardiology, Cardiovascular Research Laboratories, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, 675 Charles E.

{"abstract":"Sensory cortices contain extensive descending (corticofugal) pathways, yet their impact on brainstem processing – particularly across sensory systems – remains poorly understood. In the auditory system, the inferior colliculus (IC) in the midbrain receives cross-modal inputs from the visual cortex (VC). However, the influences from VC on auditory midbrain processing are unclear. To investigate whether and how visual cortical inputs affect IC auditory responses, the present study combines auditory blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) with cell-type specific optogenetic manipulation of visual cortex. The results show that predominant optogenetic excitation of the excitatory pyramidal neurons in the infragranular layers of the primary VC enhances the noise-evoked BOLD fMRI responses within the IC. This finding reveals that inputs from VC influence and facilitate basic sound processing in the auditory midbrain. Such combined optogenetic and auditory fMRI approach can shed light on the large-scale modulatory effects of corticofugal pathways and guide detailed electrophysiological studies in the future.","authors":"Alex T.

{"abstract":"Urinary tract obstruction during kidney development causes tubular apoptosis, tubular necrosis, and interstitial inflammation. Necroptosis is a subtype of programmed necrosis mediated by the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Necrosis induces inflammation and stimulates cell death in an autoamplification loop named necroinflammation. Here, we studied necroptosis and necroinflammation in obstructive nephropathy induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in neonatal C57Bl/6J mice. Ureteral obstruction induced tubular dilatation, tubular basement membrane thickening, cast formation, and increased expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Morphological investigations showed either apoptotic or necrotic cells in the tubular compartment. Biochemical analysis revealed increased caspase-8 activity and upregulation of RIPK3 as well as phosphorylated-MLKL in UUO-kidneys. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, INF-γ, TNF-α) were upregulated following UUO. Taken together we show that necroptosis and necroinflammation are accompanied phenomena in neonatal kidneys with obstruction. These findings may help to develop novel strategies to treat congenital obstructive nephropathy.","authors":"Bastian Popper; Marian Theodor Rammer; Mojca Gasparitsch; Teresa Singer; Ursula Keller; Yvonne Döring; Bärbel Lange-Sperandio","keywords":"Apoptosis; Kidney; Kidney diseases; Necroptosis","organization_affiliated":"Biomedical Center, Core Faciliy Animal Models, Ludwig-Maximilians university, Martinsried, Germany; Institute of Pathology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Dr. v.

{"abstract":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to diverse cellular functions and the dysregulation of their expression or function can contribute to diseases, including diabetes. The contributions of lncRNAs to β-cell development, function and survival has been extensively studied in vitro. However, very little is currently known on the in vivo roles of lncRNAs in the regulation of glucose and insulin homeostasis. Here we investigated the impact of loss-of-function in mice of the lncRNA A830019P07Rik, hereafter P07Rik, which was previously reported to be associated with reduced plasma insulin levels. Compared with wild-type littermates, male and female P07Rik mutant mice did not show any defect in glycaemia and plasma insulin levels in both fed and fasted state. Furthermore, P07Rik mutant mice displayed similar glucose and insulin levels in response to an intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test. Ex vivo, islets from mutant P07Rik released similar amount of insulin in response to increased glucose concentration as wildtype littermates. In contrast with previous reports, our characterization of P07Rik mouse mutants revealed that loss of function of this lncRNA does not affect glucose and insulin homeostasis in mice.","authors":"Claudiane Guay; Baroj Abdulkarim; Jennifer Y.

{"abstract":"Metabolic pathways that regulate T-cell function show promise as therapeutic targets in diverse diseases. Here, we show that at rest cultured human effector memory and central memory CD4+ T-cells have elevated levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), in comparison to naïve T-cells. Despite having low resting metabolic rates, naive T-cells respond to TCR stimulation with robust and rapid increases in glycolysis and OXPHOS. This early metabolic switch requires Akt activity to support increased rates of glycolysis and STAT5 activity for amino acid biosynthesis and TCA cycle anaplerosis. Importantly, both STAT5 inhibition and disruption of TCA cycle anaplerosis are associated with reduced IL-2 production, demonstrating the functional importance of this early metabolic program. Our results define STAT5 as a key node in modulating the early metabolic program following activation in naive CD4+ T-cells and in turn provide greater understanding of how cellular metabolism shapes T-cell responses. T-cell subsets differ in metabolic requirements for particular tasks. Here the authors characterize metabolic fluxes in naïve human CD4+ cells upon activation, and identify a role of Stat5 in glutaminolysis linked to IL-2 production.","authors":"Nicholas Jones; Emma E.

{"abstract":"Urothelial cells play essential roles in protection of urine exudation and bacterial invasion at the urothelial mucosa, so that defect or damage of urothelial cells associated with urinary tract diseases may cause serious problems. If a sufficient number of functional urothelial cells are prepared in culture and transplanted into the damaged urothelial lesions, such technology may provide beneficial effects to patients with diseases of the urinary tract. Here we found that human adult dermal fibroblasts were converted into urothelial cells by transducing genes for four transcription factors, FOXA1, TP63, MYCL and KLF4 (FTLK). The directly converted urothelial cells (dUCs) formed cobblestone-like colonies and expressed urothelium-specific markers. dUCs were successfully expanded and enriched after serial passages using a specific medium that we optimized for the cells. The passaged dUCs showed similar genome-wide gene expression profiles to normal urothelial cells and had a barrier function. The FTLK-transduced fibroblasts were also converted into urothelial cells in vivo and recruited to the regenerating urothelial tissue after they were transplanted into the bladder of mice with interstitial cystitis. Our technology may provide a promising solution for a number of patients with urinary tract disorders.","authors":"Yuta Inoue; Tsunao Kishida; Shin-ichiro Kotani; Mika Akiyoshi; Hideto Taga; Makoto Seki; Osamu Ukimura; Osam Mazda","keywords":"Bladder; Bladder disease; Regenerative medicine; Reprogramming; Transdifferentiation","organization_affiliated":"Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; CellAxia Inc. 1-10-9-6F Nihonbashi Horidome-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; CellAxia Inc. 1-10-9-6F Nihonbashi Horidome-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan","title":"Direct conversion of fibroblasts into urothelial cells that may be recruited to regenerating mucosa of injured urinary bladder","id":"94b49e62-2afc-4771-8222-ca263bd33cfc"}

{"abstract":"Metal/mineral dyshomeostasis has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim of the study was to investigate the difference in absolute and percentage levels of plasma phosphorus, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, selenium in cognitively normal (CN) and AD subjects. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy was used to detect plasma metals/minerals in CN and AD subjects (n = 44 per group). TXRF detected significantly increased plasma levels of phosphorus (p = 1.33 × 10−12) and calcium (p = 0.025) in AD compared to CN subjects, with higher phosphorus/calcium (p = 2.55 × 10−14) ratio in the former. Percentage concentrations calculated for phosphorus, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, selenium by dividing the concentration of each element by the total concentration of these elements and multiplying by 100%, demonstrated phosphorus was higher in AD compared to CN subjects, while calcium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium were lower in AD subjects, with area under the curves as high as 0.937 (p = 6 × 10−5) computed from receiver operating curves. With exclusion of high levels of phosphorus and calcium from percentage calculations, iron levels remained low in AD whereas zinc was higher in AD, and copper and selenium levels were similar. We demonstrate altered distribution of elements in the plasma of AD subjects with high interdependencies between elemental levels and propose the potential of TXRF measurements for disease monitoring.","authors":"Azhaar Ashraf; Hagen Stosnach; Harold G.

{"abstract":"Multimode entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, multimode entangled states are generally constructed by targeting a specific graph configuration. This yields to a fixed experimental setup that therefore exhibits reduced versatility and scalability. Here we demonstrate an optical on-demand, reconfigurable multimode entangled state, using an intrinsically multimode quantum resource and a homodyne detection apparatus. Without altering either the initial squeezing source or experimental architecture, we realize the construction of thirteen cluster states of various sizes and connectivities as well as the implementation of a secret sharing protocol. In particular, this system enables the interrogation of quantum correlations and fluctuations for any multimode Gaussian state. This initiates an avenue for implementing on-demand quantum information processing by only adapting the measurement process and not the experimental layout. Multimode entanglement is an important resource for quantum information processing, but setups are often able to generate specific configurations only. Here the authors present an on-demand reconfigurable multimode entangled state source, realizing thirteen cluster states of various sizes and connectivities.","authors":"Y. Cai; J. Roslund; G.

{"abstract":"We report the results of an analysis of unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) in 71 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) transplanted in EBMT centers between 2005 and 2017. Median age was 9.3 years; graft type was bone marrow in 79% and peripheral blood in 21%. Recipient–donor HLA match at high resolution typing was 10/10 in 31, 9/10 in 20, and 8/10 in 4 patients; the other patients had intermediate resolution typing. The most frequent conditioning regimens were fludarabine–thiotepa–treosulfan (64%) or busulfan–cyclophosphamide (12%). Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 92%; platelet engraftment was 90%. Eleven patients (15%) experienced graft failure. Grade II–IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) was 23%; 3-year chronic GvHD was 23%. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 88 ± 4%. GRFS was 62 ± 6%. HLA matching was the most significant risk factor for OS: 3-year OS was 96 ± 4% in 10/10 group vs. 75 ± 10% in 9–8/10 (p = 0.042); GRFS was 69 ± 9% vs. 50 ± 12% (p = 0.114), respectively. In conclusion, unrelated donor HSCT is a valid option for SCD patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor, preferably in the context of clinical trials. Using a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor yields better survival indicating that HLA matching is an important donor selection factor in this nonmalignant disease.","authors":"Eliane Gluckman; Josu de la Fuente; Barbara Cappelli; Graziana M.

{"abstract":"Increased plasma concentrations of acylcarnitines (ACs) are suggested as a marker of metabolism disorders. The aim of the present study was to clarify which tissues are responsible for changes in the AC pool in plasma. The concentrations of medium- and long-chain ACs were changing during the fed-fast cycle in rat heart, muscles and liver. After 60 min running exercise, AC content was increased in fasted mice muscles, but not in plasma or heart. After glucose bolus administration in fasted rats, the AC concentrations in plasma decreased after 30 min but then began to increase, while in the muscles and liver, the contents of medium- and long-chain ACs were unchanged or even increased. Only the heart showed a decrease in medium- and long-chain AC contents that was similar to that observed in plasma. In isolated rat heart, but not isolated-contracting mice muscles, the significant efflux of medium- and long-chain ACs was observed. The efflux was reduced by 40% after the addition of glucose and insulin to the perfusion solution. Overall, these results indicate that during fed-fast cycle shifting the heart determines the medium- and long-chain AC profile in plasma, due to a rapid response to the availability of circulating energy substrates.","authors":"Marina Makrecka-Kuka; Eduards Sevostjanovs; Karlis Vilks; Kristine Volska; Unigunde Antone; Janis Kuka; Elina Makarova; Osvalds Pugovics; Maija Dambrova; Edgars Liepinsh","keywords":"Fat metabolism; Fatty acids","organization_affiliated":"Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; University of Latvia, Faculty of Biology, Jelgavas Str. 1, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Riga Stradins University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Dzirciema Str. 16, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia; Riga Stradins University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Dzirciema Str. 16, Riga, Latvia; Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Aizkraukles Str. 21, Riga, Latvia","title":"Plasma acylcarnitine concentrations reflect the acylcarnitine profile in cardiac tissues","id":"eba39b0d-3fb5-4abe-88ac-a658d7fc46ac"}
{"abstract":"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) follows the principle of formulae, in which the pharmacological activity of a single herb can be enhanced or potentiated by addition of other herbs. Nevertheless, the involved synergy mechanisms in formulae remain unknown. Here, a systems-based method is proposed and applied to three representative Chinese medicines in compound saffron formula (CSF): two animal spices (Moschus, Beaver Castoreum), and one herb Crocus sativus which exert synergistic effects for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). From the formula, 42 ingredients and 66 corresponding targets are acquired based on the ADME evaluation and target fishing model. The network relationships between the compounds and targets are assembled with CVDs pathways to elucidate the synergistic therapeutic effects between the spices and the herbs. The results show that different compounds of the three medicines show similar curative activity in CVDs. Additionally, the active compounds from them shared CVDs-relevant targets (multiple compounds-one target), or functional diversity targets but with clinical relevance (multiple compounds-multiple targets-one disease). Moreover, the targets of them are largely enriched in the same CVDs pathways (multiple targets-one pathway). These results elucidate why animal spices and herbs can have pharmacologically synergistic effects on CVDs, which provides a new way for drug discovery.","authors":"Jianling Liu; Jingjing Liu; Fengxia Shen; Zonghui Qin; Meng Jiang; Jinglin Zhu; Zhenzhong Wang; Jun Zhou; Yingxue Fu; Xuetong Chen; Chao Huang; Wei Xiao; Chunli Zheng; Yonghua Wang","keywords":"Cardiovascular biology; Computer science","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi’an, China; State Key Laboratory of New-tech for Chinese Medicine Pharmaceutical Process, Jiangsu Kanion Parmaceutical Co.

{"abstract":"The phenomenon of “remote synchronization” (RS), first observed in a star network of oscillators, involves synchronization of unconnected peripheral nodes through a hub that maintains independent dynamics. In the RS regime the central hub was thought to serve as a passive gate for information transfer between nodes. Here, we investigate the physical origin of this phenomenon. Surprisingly, we find that a hub node can drive remote synchronization of peripheral oscillators even in the presence of a repulsive mean field, thus actively governing network dynamics while remaining asynchronous. We study this novel phenomenon in complex networks endowed with multiple hub-nodes, a ubiquitous feature of many real-world systems, including brain connectivity networks. We show that a change in the natural frequency of a single hub can alone reshape synchronization patterns across the entire network, and switch from direct to remote synchronization, or to hub-driven desynchronization. Hub-driven RS may provide a mechanism to account for the role of structural hubs in the organization of brain functional connectivity networks.","authors":"Vladimir Vlasov; Angelo Bifone","keywords":"Complex networks; Dynamical systems; Network models; Nonlinear phenomena","organization_affiliated":"Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Corso Bettini, 31, Rovereto, Italy; Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Corso Bettini, 31, Rovereto, Italy","title":"Hub-driven remote synchronization in brain networks","id":"0080490a-36f7-4f66-ae51-b3b5dad19174"}

{"abstract":"Free-electron lasers (FELs) in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray regime opened up the possibility for experiments at high power densities, in particular allowing for fluence-dependent absorption and scattering experiments to reveal non-linear light–matter interactions at ever shorter wavelengths. Findings of such non-linear effects are met with tremendous interest, but prove difficult to understand and model due to the inherent shot-to-shot fluctuations in photon intensity and the often structured, non-Gaussian spatial intensity profile of a focused FEL beam. Presently, the focused beam is characterized and optimized separately from the actual experiment. Here, we present the simultaneous measurement of XUV diffraction signals from solid samples in tandem with the corresponding single-shot spatial fluence distribution on the actual sample. Our in situ characterization scheme enables direct monitoring of the sample illumination, providing a basis to optimize and quantitatively understand FEL experiments.

{"abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on centric condyle positions lack 3D comparisons of guided and unguided methods, which are used for accomplishing centric relation reference positions. The purpose of this study was to describe the space, in which mandibular condyles are placed in vivo by dental intercuspation, Dawson’s bimanual manipulation, and neuromuscular position. Twenty asymptomatic individuals aged 23 to 37 years underwent separate bite registrations using bimanual manipulation and the unguided neuromuscular technique. Subsequent 3-Tesla MRI scans of both temporomandibular joints yielded 3D data of the most superior condylar points at maximum intercuspation and both centric relation positions. We found concentric condyle positions in maximum intercuspation but considerable variation of condyle position after bimanual manipulation and neuromuscular technique. Their 95% predictive confidence ellipses overlapped substantially and created a space of reference positions. Its smallest volume averaged 2 mm3 for a minimal convex hull (95% confidence interval 1.1–3.2) and 3.5 mm3 for a minimal ellipsoid hull (95% confidence interval 1.8–5.4). Visualized in vivo by MRI, condyle positions at bimanual manipulation and neuromuscular position were not predictable and showed substantial variation in asymptomatic subjects.

{"abstract":"Radiative cooling is a passive cooling strategy with zero consumption of electricity that can be used to radiate heat from buildings to reduce air-conditioning requirements. Although this technology can work well during optimal atmospheric conditions at night, it is essential to achieve efficient cooling during the daytime when peak cooling demand actually occurs. Here we report an inexpensive planar polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/metal thermal emitter thin film structure, which was fabricated using a fast solution coating process that is scalable for large-area manufacturing. By performing tests under different environmental conditions, temperature reductions of 9.5 °C and 11.0 °C were demonstrated in the laboratory and an outside environment, respectively, with an average cooling power of ~120 W m–2 for the thin film thermal emitter. In addition, a spectral-selective structure was designed and implemented to suppress the solar input and control the divergence of the thermal emission beam. This enhanced the directionality of the thermal emissions, so the emitter’s cooling performance was less dependent on the surrounding environment. Outside experiments were performed in Buffalo, New York, realizing continuous all-day cooling of ~2–9 °C on a typical clear sunny day at Northern United States latitudes. This practical strategy that cools without electricity input could have a significant impact on global energy consumption. Radiative cooling can reduce air-conditioning requirements. In this study, the authors demonstrated an inexpensive thermal emitter that provided continuous daytime cooling up to 9 °C outdoors on a clear, sunny New York day.","authors":"Lyu Zhou; Haomin Song; Jianwei Liang; Matthew Singer; Ming Zhou; Edgars Stegenburgs; Nan Zhang; Chen Xu; Tien Ng; Zongfu Yu; Boon Ooi; Qiaoqiang Gan","keywords":"Civil engineering; Green photonics; Materials for optics; Renewable energy; Technology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA; KAUST Nanophotonics Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; KAUST Nanophotonics Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA; KAUST Nanophotonics Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA; School of Life Information Science and Instrument Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China; KAUST Nanophotonics Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA; KAUST Nanophotonics Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA","title":"A polydimethylsiloxane-coated metal structure for all-day radiative cooling","id":"b891453c-e682-4b8b-96dc-9211d724b2b0"}
{"abstract":"Understanding the physiological implications of caging conditions for mice is crucial in improving the replicability and reliability of animal research. Individual caging of mice is known to alter mouse psychology, such as triggering depression-like symptoms in mice, suggesting that caging conditions could have negative effects on mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that individual caging could affect the physical composition of outbred mice. To investigate this, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to compare the mass, bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue percentage and fat tissue percentage between group and individual caged mice. We also conducted open field test to compare mouse activities in different caging conditions. Our results showed significantly reduced BMD and lean tissue percentage and significantly increased fat tissue percentage in individually-caged male mice. Furthermore, there were no differences in body mass and activity between the grouped and individual mice, suggesting that these physical alterations were not induced by group-related activity. In this study, we conclude that individual caging could alter the body composition of mice without affecting external morphology.","authors":"Jisu Shin; Jiwan Woo; Yakdol Cho; Yoon Hee Choi; Naewoo Neo Shin; YoungSoo Kim","keywords":"Animal disease models; Bone","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pharmacy, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea; Research Animal Resource Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea; Research Animal Resource Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea; Department of Pharmacy, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea; Integrated Science and Engineering Division, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea; Department of Pharmacy, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea; Integrated Science and Engineering Division, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea","title":"Four-week individual caging of male ICR mice alters body composition without change in body mass","id":"aa344f2c-b122-4757-b1e0-b43baa74c1f6"}
{"abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is one of the world’s leading causes of cancer-related death. Activation of STAT3 has been reported as a major contributor in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. However, treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer patients with STAT3 inhibitors often meets drug resistance and heterogeneous response. We found that EGFR activation is a main cause for resistance to STAT3 inhibitors in pancreatic cancer cells, regardless of KRAS mutation status. Mechanistically, inhibition of STAT3 promotes STAT1- and STAT4-mediated TGF-α expression, leading to activation of the EGFR pathway. Combined treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with EGFR and STAT3 inhibitors persistently blocks EGFR and STAT3 signaling, and exerts synergistic antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, with or without KRAS mutation. Our results indicate that reciprocal cross-talk between STAT3 and EGFR pathways is a key molecular mechanism leading to resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, the study shows that combined inhibition of both EGFR and STAT3 might overcome drug resistance encountered during treatment with single agent alone. This study suggests an improved therapeutic strategy, through combined treatment with STAT3 and EGFR inhibitors, for pancreatic cancer patients.","authors":"Chengguang Zhao; Lehe Yang; Feng Zhou; Yun Yu; Xiaojing Du; Youqun Xiang; Chenglong Li; Xiaoying Huang; Congying Xie; Zhiguo Liu; Jiayuh Lin; Liangxing Wang; Guang Liang; Ri Cui","keywords":"Cancer therapy; Cell signalling","organization_affiliated":"Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Wenzhou University-Wenzhou Medical University Collaborative Innovation Center of Biomedical, Wenzhou, China; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Wenzhou University-Wenzhou Medical University Collaborative Innovation Center of Biomedical, Wenzhou, China; Cancer and Anticancer Drug Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Wenzhou University-Wenzhou Medical University Collaborative Innovation Center of Biomedical, Wenzhou, China","title":"Feedback activation of EGFR is the main cause for STAT3 inhibition-irresponsiveness in pancreatic cancer cells","id":"dab79bc5-d5cf-4048-8166-5205413bfe58"}
{"abstract":"The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of α-pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early generation products remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty) by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two long-lived reservoirs—volatile oxidized gases and low-volatility particulate matter. Nearly all organic carbon has now been quantified and characterized in a highly complex evolving atmospheric system, specifically, the multigenerational oxidation of α-pinene. It has been observed that initial addition of functional groups quickly gives way to fragmentation reactions, with organic carbon ultimately becoming sequestered in chemically resistant reservoirs: organic aerosols and long-lived gas-phase species.

{"abstract":"Since years, research on SnRK1, the major cellular energy sensor in plants, has tried to define its role in energy signalling. However, these attempts were notoriously hampered by the lethality of a complete knockout of SnRK1. Therefore, we generated an inducible amiRNA::SnRK1α2 in a snrk1α1 knock out background (snrk1α1/α2) to abolish SnRK1 activity to understand major systemic functions of SnRK1 signalling under energy deprivation triggered by extended night treatment. We analysed the in vivo phosphoproteome, proteome and metabolome and found that activation of SnRK1 is essential for repression of high energy demanding cell processes such as protein synthesis. The most abundant effect was the constitutively high phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) in the snrk1α1/α2 mutant. RPS6 is a major target of TOR signalling and its phosphorylation correlates with translation. Further evidence for an antagonistic SnRK1 and TOR crosstalk comparable to the animal system was demonstrated by the in vivo interaction of SnRK1α1 and RAPTOR1B in the cytosol and by phosphorylation of RAPTOR1B by SnRK1α1 in kinase assays. Moreover, changed levels of phosphorylation states of several chloroplastic proteins in the snrk1α1/α2 mutant indicated an unexpected link to regulation of photosynthesis, the main energy source in plants.","authors":"Ella Nukarinen; Thomas Nägele; Lorenzo Pedrotti; Bernhard Wurzinger; Andrea Mair; Ramona Landgraf; Frederik Börnke; Johannes Hanson; Markus Teige; Elena Baena-Gonzalez; Wolfgang Dröge-Laser; Wolfram Weckwerth","keywords":"Plant signalling; Systems analysis","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Vienna Metabolomics Center (VIME), University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Julius-von-Sachs-Institut, Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Plant Health, Plant Metabolism Group, Leibniz-Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops, Großbeeren, Germany; Plant Health, Plant Metabolism Group, Leibniz-Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops, Großbeeren, Germany; Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; Department of Plant Physiology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden; Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, Portugal; Julius-von-Sachs-Institut, Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Vienna Metabolomics Center (VIME), University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria","title":"Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals the role of the AMPK plant ortholog SnRK1 as a metabolic master regulator under energy deprivation","id":"dcf179cd-dcb8-4562-a708-4692355af1e4"}
{"abstract":"The genus Enterovirus (EV) of the family Picornaviridae includes poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, numbered enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. These diverse viruses cause a variety of diseases, including non-specific febrile illness, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, neonatal sepsis-like disease, encephalitis, paralysis and respiratory diseases. In recent years, several non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) have emerged as serious public health concerns. These include EV-A71, which has caused epidemics of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in Southeast Asia, and EV-D68, which recently caused a large outbreak of severe lower respiratory tract disease in North America. Infections with these viruses are associated with severe neurological complications. For decades, most research has focused on poliovirus, but in recent years, our knowledge of NPEVs has increased considerably. In this Review, we summarize recent insights from enterovirus research with a special emphasis on NPEVs. We discuss virion structures, host–receptor interactions, viral uncoating and the recent discovery of a universal enterovirus host factor that is involved in viral genome release. Moreover, we briefly explain the mechanisms of viral genome replication, virion assembly and virion release, and describe potential targets for antiviral therapy. We reflect on how these recent discoveries may help the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines.

{"abstract":"Herein, multiwalled carbon nanotube-based Fe3O4 nano-adsorbents (Fe3O4@MWCNT) were synthesized by ultrasonic reduction method. The synthesized nano-adsorbent (Fe3O4@MWCNT) exhibited efficient sonocatalytic activity to remove Maxilon Blue 5G, a textile dye, and present in a cationic form, in aqueous solution under ultrasonic irradiation. The magnetic nano-adsorbent particles were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Some important parameters such as nano-adsorbent dosage, solution pH, initial dye and H2O2 concentration, reaction time, ultrasonic power and temperature were tested to determine the optimum conditions for the elimination of Maxilon Blue 5G dye. The reusability results showed that Fe3O4@MWCNT nano-adsorbent has a decrease of about 32.15% in the removal efficiency of Maxilon Blue 5G under ultrasonic irradiation after six times reuse. Additionally, in order to reveal the sufficient kinetic explanation, various experiments were performed at different temperatures and testing three kinetic models like the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion for removal adsorption process of Maxilon Blue 5G using Fe3O4@MWCNT nano-adsorbent. The experimental kinetic results revealed that the adsorption process of Maxilon Blue 5G in the aquatic mediums using sono-Fenton method was found to be compatible with the intraparticle diffusion. Using kinetic models and studies, some activation parameters like enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy for the adsorption process were calculated. The activation parameters indicated that Fe3O4@MWCNT nano-adsorbent could be used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of Maxilon Blue 5G as a textile dye and the adsorption process of Maxilon Blue 5G with Fe3O4@MWCNT nano-adsorbent is spontaneous.","authors":"Mehmet Salih Nas; Esra Kuyuldar; Buse Demirkan; Mehmet Harbi Calimli; Ozkan Demirbaş; Fatih Sen","keywords":"Catalysis; Heterogeneous catalysis","organization_affiliated":"Department of Environmental, Faculty of Engineering, University of Igdir, Igdir, Turkey; Sen Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Arts and Science, Dumlupınar University, Evliya Çelebi Campus, Kütahya, Turkey; Sen Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Arts and Science, Dumlupınar University, Evliya Çelebi Campus, Kütahya, Turkey; Tuzluca Vocational High School, Igdir University, Igdir, Turkey; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Literature, University of Balikesir, Balikesir, Turkey; Sen Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Arts and Science, Dumlupınar University, Evliya Çelebi Campus, Kütahya, Turkey","title":"Magnetic nanocomposites decorated on multiwalled carbon nanotube for removal of Maxilon Blue 5G using the sono-Fenton method","id":"a1b103cd-926a-46d9-8192-9b0b83a2756e"}
{"abstract":"Organic photovoltaic cells are partiuclarly sensitive to exciton harvesting and are thus, a useful platform for the characterization of exciton diffusion. While device photocurrent spectroscopy can be used to extract the exciton diffusion length, this method is frequently limited by unknown interfacial recombination losses. We resolve this limitation and demonstrate a general, device-based photocurrent-ratio measurement to extract the intrinsic diffusion length. Since interfacial losses are not active layer specific, a ratio of the donor- and acceptor-material internal quantum efficiencies cancels this quantity. We further show that this measurement permits extraction of additional device-relevant information regarding exciton relaxation and charge separation processes. The generality of this method is demonstrated by measuring exciton transport for both luminescent and dark materials, as well as for small molecule and polymer active materials and semiconductor quantum dots. Thus, we demonstrate a broadly applicable device-based methodology to probe the intrinsic active material exciton diffusion length. Zhang et al. develop a device-based method to probe intrinsic exciton transport in photovoltaic cells. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated by measuring exciton transport for both luminescent and dark organic semiconductors as well as semiconductor quantum dots.","authors":"Tao Zhang; Dana B.

{"abstract":"Flowers and leaves each represent suites of functionally interrelated traits that are often involved in species divergence and local adaptation. However, a major unresolved issue is how the individual component traits that make up a complex trait such as a flower evolve in a coordinated fashion to retain a high degree of functionality. We use a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach to elucidate the genetic architecture of divergence in flower and leaf traits between the sister species Primulina depressa and Primulina danxiaensis, which grow sympatrically but in contrasting microhabitats. We found that flower traits were controlled by multiple QTL of small effect, while leaf physiological and morphological traits tended to be controlled by QTL of larger effect. The observed floral integration, manifested by a high degree overlap in both individual trait QTL and QTL for principal component scores (PCA QTL), may have been critical for evolutionary divergence of floral morphology in relation to their pollinators. This overlap suggests that direct selection on only one or a few of the component traits could have caused substantial divergence in other floral traits due to genetic correlations, while the low QTL overlap between floral and vegetative traits suggests that these trait suites are genetically unlinked and can evolve independently in response to different selective pressures corresponding to their distinct functions.","authors":"Chen Feng; Chao Feng; Lihua Yang; Ming Kang; Mark D.

{"abstract":"Activation of the innate immune system is thought to contribute to depression. Multiple social and behavioral factors are also known to instigate depression. Whether these socio-behavioral factors interact with inflammatory stimuli to alter proinflammatory responses and depressed mood is not known. In 115 healthy adults, social, emotional, and behavioral factors were assessed at baseline. A single infusion of endotoxin (Escherichia coli; 0.8 ng/kg of body weight) or placebo (0.9% saline) was administered with hourly assessment of depressed mood and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6); tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)). Inflammatory gene expression was examined at 30 min after infusion, prior to increase of inflammatory cytokines. As compared to placebo, endotoxin-induced increases of depressed mood were moderated by baseline levels of perceived stress, trait sensitivity to social disconnection, and severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression (all Ps \u003c 0.05) but not early life stress, social status, social support, neuroticism, or sleep disturbance. Anxiety symptoms remained significant in multivariable analyses (P \u003c 0.01). None of these socio-behavioral factors were related to increases in proinflammatory cytokines. Transcriptome profiling analyses indicated that perceived stress, sensitivity to social disconnection, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways (i.e., activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB) in response to endotoxin (all Ps \u003c 0.05). These results indicate that an array of socio-behavioral factors, which are associated with depression risk, modify vulnerability to inflammation-induced depressed mood. Together, these observations may be used to help target therapeutic interventions to mitigate occurrence of the inflammatory biotype of depression.","authors":"Michael R.

{"abstract":"Understanding the emergence of cooperation has long been a challenge across disciplines. Even if network reciprocity reflected the importance of population structure in promoting cooperation, it remains an open question how population structures can be optimized, thereby enhancing cooperation. In this paper, we attempt to apply the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to solve this highly complex problem. However, as it is hard to evaluate the fitness (cooperation level) of population structures, simply employing the canonical evolutionary algorithm (EA) may fail in optimization. Thus, we propose a new EA variant named mlEA-CPD-SFN to promote the cooperation level of scale-free networks (SFNs) in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG). Meanwhile, to verify the preceding conclusions may not be applied to this problem, we also provide the optimization results of the comparative experiment (EAcluster), which optimizes the clustering coefficient of structures. Even if preceding research concluded that highly clustered scale-free networks enhance cooperation, we find EAcluster does not perform desirably, while mlEA-CPD-SFN performs efficiently in different optimization environments. We hope that mlEA-CPD-SFN may help promote the structure of species in nature and that more general properties that enhance cooperation can be learned from the output structures.","authors":"Penghui Liu; Jing Liu","keywords":"Applied mathematics; Complex networks; Evolutionary theory","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi’an, China","title":"Multilevel Evolutionary Algorithm that Optimizes the Structure of Scale-Free Networks for the Promotion of Cooperation in the Prisoner’s Dilemma game","id":"f08674d6-2a43-4e1d-8c38-addca78b5a6e"}

We further validated PCRP mAbs by means of multiple experimental applications, including immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), and immunohistochemistry. We also conducted a meta-analysis that identified critical variables that contribute to the generation of high-quality mAbs. All validation data, protocols, and links to PCRP mAb suppliers are available at http://proteincapture.org .","authors":"Anand Venkataraman; Kun Yang; Jose Irizarry; Mark Mackiewicz; Paolo Mita; Zheng Kuang; Lin Xue; Devlina Ghosh; Shuang Liu; Pedro Ramos; Shaohui Hu; Diane Bayron Kain; Sarah Keegan; Richard Saul; Simona Colantonio; Hongyan Zhang; Florencia Pauli Behn; Guang Song; Edisa Albino; Lillyann Asencio; Leonardo Ramos; Luvir Lugo; Gloriner Morell; Javier Rivera; Kimberly Ruiz; Ruth Almodovar; Luis Nazario; Keven Murphy; Ivan Vargas; Zully Ann Rivera-Pacheco; Christian Rosa; Moises Vargas; Jessica McDade; Brian S Clark; Sooyeon Yoo; Seva G Khambadkone; Jimmy de Melo; Milanka Stevanovic; Lizhi Jiang; Yana Li; Wendy Y Yap; Brittany Jones; Atul Tandon; Elliot Campbell; Gaetano T Montelione; Stephen Anderson; Richard M Myers; Jef D Boeke; David Fenyö; Gordon Whiteley; Joel S Bader; Ignacio Pino; Daniel J Eichinger; Heng Zhu; Seth Blackshaw","keywords":"Antibody generation; Antibody isolation and purification; Transcription factors","organization_affiliated":"Solomon H.

{"abstract":"Remarkable productivity has been achieved in crop species through artificial selection and adaptation to modern agronomic practices. Whether intensive selection has changed the ability of improved cultivars to maintain high productivity across variable environments is unknown. Understanding the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity and genotype by environment (G × E) interaction will enhance crop performance predictions across diverse environments. Here we use data generated from the Genomes to Fields (G2F) Maize G × E project to assess the effect of selection on G × E variation and characterize polymorphisms associated with plasticity. Genomic regions putatively selected during modern temperate maize breeding explain less variability for yield G × E than unselected regions, indicating that improvement by breeding may have reduced G × E of modern temperate cultivars. Trends in genomic position of variants associated with stability reveal fewer genic associations and enrichment of variants 0–5000 base pairs upstream of genes, hypothetically due to control of plasticity by short-range regulatory elements. Breeding has increased crop productivity, but whether it has also changed phenotypic plasticity is unclear. Here, the authors find maize genomic regions selected for high productivity show reduced contribution to genotype by environment variation and provide evidence for regulatory control of phenotypic stability.","authors":"Joseph L.

Also the distribution in bone and osteointegration with bone of the HA:Yb/Ho material could be clearly discriminated by its bright fluorescence under NIR irradiation.

{"abstract":"In cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolves from an acute to a chronic infection phenotype. Yet, the in vivo factors influencing the evolutionary trajectory of P. aeruginosa are poorly understood. This study aimed at understanding the role of the CF lung microbiome in P. aeruginosa evolution. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro biofilm evolution of an early CF P. aeruginosa isolate, AA2, in the presence or absence of a synthetic CF lung microbiome. Whole genome sequencing of evolved populations revealed mutations in quorum sensing (QS) genes (lasR, pqsR) with and without the microbiome. Phenotypic assays confirmed decreased production of the QS molecule 3-O-C12-homoserine lactone, and QS-regulated virulence factors pyocyanin and protease. Furthermore, a mixture of lasR and lasR pqsR mutants was found, in which double mutants showed less pyocyanin and protease production than lasR mutants. While the microbial community did not influence the production of the tested P. aeruginosa virulence factors, we observed a trend towards more mutations in the transcriptional regulators gntR and mexL when P. aeruginosa was grown alone. P. aeruginosa developed resistance to β-lactam antibiotics during evolution, when grown with and without the microbiome. In conclusion, in an experimental biofilm environment, the early P. aeruginosa CF isolate AA2 evolves towards a CF-like genotype and phenotype, and most studied evolutionary adaptations are not impacted by CF microbiome members.","authors":"Eva Vandeplassche; Andrea Sass; Astrid Lemarcq; Ajai A.

{"abstract":"A failure in optic fissure fusion during development can lead to blinding malformations of the eye. Here, we report a syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, colobomatous microphthalmia, ptosis and syndactyly with or without nephropathy, associated with homozygous frameshift mutations in FAT1. We show that Fat1 knockout mice and zebrafish embryos homozygous for truncating fat1a mutations exhibit completely penetrant coloboma, recapitulating the most consistent developmental defect observed in affected individuals. In human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, the primary site for the fusion of optic fissure margins, FAT1 is localized at earliest cell-cell junctions, consistent with a role in facilitating optic fissure fusion during vertebrate eye development. Our findings establish FAT1 as a gene with pleiotropic effects in human, in that frameshift mutations cause a severe multi-system disorder whereas recessive missense mutations had been previously associated with isolated glomerulotubular nephropathy. Loss of the cadherin FAT1 has been associated with nephropathy and epithelial cell adhesion defects. Here, the authors report five families with a syndromic form of coloboma associated with homozygous frameshift variants in FAT1 and recapitulate the phenotype in mutant mice and zebrafish.","authors":"Najim Lahrouchi; Aman George; Ilham Ratbi; Ronen Schneider; Siham C.

{"abstract":"Maturation of HIV-1 particles encompasses a complex morphological transformation of Gag via an orchestrated series of proteolytic cleavage events. A longstanding question concerns the structure of the C-terminal region of CA and the peptide SP1 (CA–SP1), which represents an intermediate during maturation of the HIV-1 virus. By integrating NMR, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that in CA–SP1 tubes assembled in vitro, which represent the features of an intermediate assembly state during maturation, the SP1 peptide exists in a dynamic helix–coil equilibrium, and that the addition of the maturation inhibitors Bevirimat and DFH-055 causes stabilization of a helical form of SP1. Moreover, the maturation-arresting SP1 mutation T8I also induces helical structure in SP1 and further global dynamical and conformational changes in CA. Overall, our results show that dynamics of CA and SP1 are critical for orderly HIV-1 maturation and that small molecules can inhibit maturation by perturbing molecular motions. The process of HIV particle maturation involves complex molecular transitions. Here the authors combine NMR spectroscopy, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics simulations to provide insight into the conformational equilibria in CA-SP1 assemblies relevant to HIV-1 maturation intermediates formation.","authors":"Mingzhang Wang; Caitlin M.

{"abstract":"Oceanic mesoscale structures such as eddies and fronts can alter the propagation, breaking and subsequent turbulent mixing of wind-generated internal waves. However, it has been difficult to ascertain whether these processes affect the global-scale patterns, timing and magnitude of turbulent mixing, thereby powering the global oceanic overturning circulation and driving the transport of heat and dissolved gases. Here we present global evidence demonstrating that mesoscale features can significantly enhance turbulent mixing due to wind-generated internal waves. Using internal wave-driven mixing estimates calculated from Argo profiling floats between 30° and 45° N, we find that both the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of turbulent mixing and the response to increases in the wind energy flux are larger to a depth of at least 2,000 m in the presence of a strong and temporally uniform field of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy. Mixing is especially strong within energetic anticyclonic mesoscale features compared to cyclonic features, indicating that local modification of wind-driven internal waves is probably one mechanism contributing to the elevated mixing observed in energetic mesoscale environments. Mesoscale ocean features can alter the magnitude of turbulent mixing caused by wind-driven internal waves, an analysis of Argo float and model data suggests.","authors":"C. B. Whalen; J. A.

{"abstract":"Translocated in liposarcoma (TLS)/fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a multitasking DNA/RNA binding protein implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Upon DNA damage, TLS is recruited to the upstream region of the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) through binding to the promotor associated non-coding RNA (pncRNA) that is transcribed from and tethered at the upstream region. Binding to pncRNA is hypothesized to cause the conformational change of TLS that enables its inhibitive interaction with histone acetyltransferases and resultant repression of CCND1 expression, although no experimental proof has been obtained. Here, the closed-to-open conformational change of TLS on binding pncRNA was implied by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A small fragment (31 nucleotides) of the full-length pncRNA (602 nucleotides) was shown to be sufficient for the conformational change of TLS. Dissection of pncRNA identified the G-rich RNA sequence that is critical for the conformational change. The length of RNA was also revealed to be critical for the conformational change. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the conformational change of TLS is caused by another target DNA and RNA, telomeric DNA and telomeric repeat-containing RNA. The conformational change of TLS on binding target RNA/DNA is suggested to be essential for biological functions.","authors":"Nesreen Hamad; Tsukasa Mashima; Yudai Yamaoki; Keiko Kondo; Ryoma Yoneda; Takanori Oyoshi; Riki Kurokawa; Takashi Nagata; Masato Katahira","keywords":"DNA-binding proteins; RNA-binding proteins; Structural biology","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Graduate School of Energy Science, Kyoto, Japan; Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Graduate School of Energy Science, Kyoto, Japan; Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Research Center of Genomic Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Shizuoka University, 836 Ohya, Suruga, Shizuoka, Japan; Research Center of Genomic Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan; Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Graduate School of Energy Science, Kyoto, Japan; Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto, Japan; Graduate School of Energy Science, Kyoto, Japan","title":"RNA sequence and length contribute to RNA-induced conformational change of TLS/FUS","id":"dff3463a-21cb-479e-a254-bfd9dfc48739"}
{"abstract":"Many plants have medicinal properties due to substances known as phytochemicals. To utilize these plants in practice, numerous procedures, such as extraction, isolation and characterization methods and toxicology and bioactivity studies, must be designed and implemented. Integrated approach to process Carpobrotus edulis, a weed medicinal plant widely spread in Portugal, was developed into a closed loop of two processes: microwave assisted extraction (MAE) and activation (MAA), to produce both phytochemicals and biochar. The use of MAE for phytochemical extraction was shown to be more energy efficient than conventional Soxhlet extraction: the process time was decreased by 7–8 times, and the energy efficiency was increased by up to 97%. The yield of the extracts is of 27%. Qualitative and quantitative identification/characterization of the phytochemicals were performed by LC-MS and phytochemical screening assays. The results clearly indicated that Carpobrotus edulis is rich by flavonoids (up to 24%). The use of MAA to process the residual biomass could shorten the activation time, resulting in reduced energy consumption. Biochar with a high yield of 65% (on a biomass basis) and a well-developed texture (surface area of 68.9 m2/g; total pore volume of 0.10 cm3/g; micropore volume of 0.07 cm3/g) is obtained.","authors":"Sergiy Lyubchyk; Olesia Shapovalova; Olena Lygina; Maria Conceiçao Oliveira; Nurbol Appazov; Andriy Lyubchyk; Adilia Januario Charmier; Svetlana Lyubchik; Armando J.

{"abstract":"To evaluate the use of sedatives and analgesics during therapeutic hypothermia in encephalopathic neonates and assess associations between medication exposure and hospital outcomes. We identified neonates ≥35 weeks gestational age treated with therapeutic hypothermia at 125 neonatal intensive care units between 2007 and 2015. We compared characteristics and hospital outcomes between unexposed neonates and neonates exposed to opioids and/or benzodiazepines. Opioids were administered to 1 677/2 621 (64%) neonates, and exposure increased from 38% in 2008 to 68% in 2015. Sedation/analgesia varied widely between centers. Opioid-exposed neonates experienced greater durations of respiratory support and were more likely to receive inotropes and inhaled nitric oxide. Mortality during postnatal days 0–3 was lower among opioid-exposed neonates (31/625 [5%]) than unexposed neonates (64/714 [9%]). Sedation/analgesia during therapeutic hypothermia is prevalent but not uniform across centers.

{"abstract":"De novo protein design holds promise for creating small stable proteins with shapes customized to bind therapeutic targets. We describe a massively parallel approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders, integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660 mini-proteins of 37–43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing. A massively parallel computational and experimental approach for de novo designing and screening small hyperstable proteins targeting influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B identifies new therapeutic candidates more robust than traditional antibody therapies. De novo protein design is a powerful tool for preparing small proteins with desired folds and functions. In this work, David Baker and colleagues report a combined computational and experimental approach to designing and screening folded mini-proteins, consisting of around 40 residues, to bind and target influenza haemagglutinin, a protein on the surface of the flu virus, and botulinum neurotoxin B, a cause of botulism. This high-throughput method produces binding proteins that are more stable and much smaller than traditional antibody therapies, that can be readily modulated and that elicit very little immune response. The optimal haemagglutinin binders show protection against influenza infection in vivo, illustrating the potential of this method for antiviral and other therapeutic applications.","authors":"Aaron Chevalier; Daniel-Adriano Silva; Gabriel J.

{"abstract":"The long-term risks and time trends of subsequent primary neoplasms (SPNs) among Ewing (ES) and osteosarcoma (OS) survivors are not fully understood. We performed a nationwide study of all ES and OS patients identified in the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958 to 2015 with up to 58 years of follow-up. The risk of SPN was compared with that of the general population using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs). One hundred and fifteen SPNs were diagnosed among 1779 patients with ES or OS, yielding an overall SIR of 2.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9–2.7). The risk remained significantly increased in the latest treatment era (SIR2000-2015 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5). The highest absolute excess risks (AER) was due to breast cancer (AER 15.2/10,000 person-years; 95% CI, 5.0–29.8) followed by female genital malignancies (AER 9.5/10,000 person-years; 95% CI, 2.4–21.5). The excess breast cancer risk among ES survivors was noted also after 30 years of follow-up with 127 extra breast cancers/10,000 person-years (95% CI, 6.6–419). Breast- and female genital malignancies contribute most to the excess risk of SPN among ES and OS survivors.

{"abstract":"Organic materials are receiving an increasing amount of attention as electrode materials for future post lithium-ion batteries due to their versatility and sustainability. However, their electrochemical reaction mechanism has seldom been investigated. This is a direct consequence of a lack of straightforward and broadly available analytical techniques. Herein, a straightforward in operando attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy method is developed that allows visualization of changes of all infrared active bands that occur as a consequence of reduction/oxidation processes. In operando infrared spectroscopy is applied to the analysis of three different organic polymer materials in lithium batteries. Moreover, this in operando method is further extended to investigation of redox reaction mechanism of poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) in a magnesium battery, where a reduction of carbonyl bond is demonstrated as a mechanism of electrochemical activity. Conclusions done by the in operando results are complemented by synthesis of model compound and density functional theory calculation of infrared spectra. Metal-organic batteries are gaining traction as versatile, low-cost, and sustainable devices, although there are still few ways to probe internal behavior during use. Here, the authors explore organic-molecule structural changes within several battery systems by in operando infrared spectroscopy.","authors":"Alen Vizintin; Jan Bitenc; Anja Kopač Lautar; Klemen Pirnat; Jože Grdadolnik; Jernej Stare; Anna Randon-Vitanova; Robert Dominko","keywords":"Batteries; Characterization and analytical techniques","organization_affiliated":"National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Honda R\u0026D Europe GmbH, Offenbach, Germany; National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia","title":"Probing electrochemical reactions in organic cathode materials via in operando infrared spectroscopy","id":"b02e2e3a-900e-4ab4-b20f-8cde69aa16b7"}

{"abstract":"The Portuguese man of war, Physalia physalis, is one of the most conspicuous, but poorly understood members of the pleuston, a community of organisms that occupy a habitat at the sea-air interface. Physalia physalis is a siphonophore that uses a gas-filled float as a sail to catch the wind. The development, morphology, and colony organization of P. physalis is very different from all other siphonophores. Here, we look at live and fixed larval and juvenile specimens, and use optical projection tomography to build on existing knowledge about the morphology and development of this species. We also propose a framework for homologizing the axes with other siphonophores, and also suggest that the tentacle bearing zooids should be called tentacular palpons. Previous descriptions of P. physalis larvae, especially descriptions of budding order, were often framed with the mature colony in mind. However, we use the simpler organization of larvae and the juvenile specimens to inform our understanding of the morphology, budding order, and colony organization in the mature specimen. Finally, we review what is known about the ecology and lifecycle of P. physalis.","authors":"Catriona Munro; Zer Vue; Richard R. Behringer; Casey W.

{"abstract":"The Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus (Dn) causes footrot in ruminants, a debilitating and highly contagious disease that results in necrotic hooves and significant economic losses in agriculture. Vaccination with crude whole-cell vaccine mixed with multiple recombinant fimbrial proteins can provide protection during species-specific outbreaks, but subunit vaccines containing broadly cross-protective antigens are desirable. We have investigated two D. nodosus candidate vaccine antigens. Macrophage Infectivity Potentiator Dn-MIP (DNO_0012, DNO_RS00050) and Adhesin Complex Protein Dn-ACP (DNO_0725, DNO_RS06795) are highly conserved amongst ~170 D. nodosus isolates in the https://pubmlst.org/dnodosus/ database. We describe the presence of two homologous ACP domains in Dn-ACP with potent C-type lysozyme inhibitor function, and homology of Dn-MIP to other putative cell-surface and membrane-anchored MIP virulence factors. Immunization of mice with recombinant proteins with a variety of adjuvants induced antibodies that recognised both proteins in D. nodosus. Notably, immunization with fimbrial-whole-cell Footvax vaccine induced anti-Dn-ACP and anti-Dn-MIP antibodies. Although all adjuvants induced high titre antibody responses, only antisera to rDn-ACP-QuilA and rDn-ACP-Al(OH)3 significantly prevented rDn-ACP protein from inhibiting lysozyme activity in vitro. Therefore, a vaccine incorporating rDn-ACP in particular could contribute to protection by enabling normal innate immune lysozyme function to aid bacterial clearance.","authors":"Maria Victoria Humbert; Alexandra Jackson; Christian M.

{"abstract":"Despite growing scientific interest in the placebo effect and increasing understanding of neurobiological mechanisms, theoretical modeling of the placebo response remains poorly developed. The most extensively accepted theories are expectation and conditioning, involving both conscious and unconscious information processing. However, it is not completely understood how these mechanisms can shape the placebo response. We focus here on neural processes which can account for key properties of the response to substance intake. It is shown that placebo response can be conceptualized as a reaction of a distributed neural system within the central nervous system. Such a reaction represents an integrated component of the response to open substance administration (or to substance intake) and is updated through “unconditioned stimulus (UCS) revaluation learning”. The analysis leads to a theorem, which proves the existence of two distinct quantities coded within the brain, these are the expected or prediction outcome and the reactive response. We show that the reactive response is updated automatically by implicit revaluation learning, while the expected outcome can also be modulated through conscious information processing. Conceptualizing the response to substance intake in terms of UCS revaluation learning leads to the theoretical formulation of a potential neuropharmacological treatment for increasing unlimitedly the effectiveness of a given drug.","authors":"Luca Puviani; Sidita Rama","keywords":"Classical conditioning; Learning algorithms; Placebo effect; Target identification","organization_affiliated":"Department of Engineering “Enzo Ferrari”, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; MD at Local Health Unit of Modena, Modena, Italy","title":"Placebo Response is Driven by UCS Revaluation: Evidence, Neurophysiological Consequences and a Quantitative Model","id":"533cdcdd-2578-4fed-be51-64cc1417b1cd"}
{"abstract":"Multimodal imaging combines complementary platforms for spatially resolved tissue analysis that are poised for application in life science and personalized medicine. Unlike established clinical in vivo multimodality imaging, automated workflows for in-depth multimodal molecular ex vivo tissue analysis that combine the speed and ease of spectroscopic imaging with molecular details provided by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) are lagging behind. Here, we present an integrated approach that utilizes non-destructive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI for analysing single-slide tissue specimen. We show that FTIR microscopy can automatically guide high-resolution MSI data acquisition and interpretation without requiring prior histopathological tissue annotation, thus circumventing potential human-annotation-bias while achieving \u003e90% reductions of data load and acquisition time. We apply FTIR imaging as an upstream modality to improve accuracy of tissue-morphology detection and to retrieve diagnostic molecular signatures in an automated, unbiased and spatially aware manner. We show the general applicability of multimodal FTIR-guided MALDI-MSI by demonstrating precise tumor localization in mouse brain bearing glioma xenografts and in human primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Finally, the presented multimodal tissue analysis method allows for morphology-sensitive lipid signature retrieval from brains of mice suffering from lipidosis caused by Niemann-Pick type C disease.","authors":"Jan-Hinrich Rabe; Denis A.

{"abstract":"Genetic diversity of closely related free-living microorganisms is widespread and underpins ecosystem functioning, but most evolutionary theories predict that it destabilizes intimate mutualisms. Accordingly, strain diversity is assumed to be highly restricted in intracellular bacteria associated with animals. Here, we sequenced metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of 18 Bathymodiolus mussel individuals from four species, covering their known distribution range at deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Atlantic. We show that as many as 16 strains of intracellular, sulfur-oxidizing symbionts coexist in individual Bathymodiolus mussels. Co-occurring symbiont strains differed extensively in key functions, such as the use of energy and nutrient sources, electron acceptors and viral defence mechanisms. Most strain-specific genes were expressed, highlighting their potential to affect fitness. We show that fine-scale diversity is pervasive in Bathymodiolus sulfur-oxidizing symbionts, and hypothesize that it may be widespread in low-cost symbioses where the environment, rather than the host, feeds the symbionts. Using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, up to 16 strains of intracellular, sulfur-oxidizing symbiotic bacteria were identified in individual mussels with different functions, indicating that high strain diversity is present in symbioses.","authors":"Rebecca Ansorge; Stefano Romano; Lizbeth Sayavedra; Miguel Ángel González Porras; Anne Kupczok; Halina E.

{"abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is 15 times more prevalent among persons in Spain’s prisons than in the community. Recently, Spain initiated a pilot program, JAILFREE-C, to treat HCV in prisons using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Our aim was to identify a cost-effective strategy to scale-up HCV treatment in all prisons. Using a validated agent-based model, we simulated the HCV landscape in Spain’s prisons considering disease transmission, screening, treatment, and prison-community dynamics. Costs and disease outcomes under status quo were compared with strategies to scale-up treatment in prisons considering prioritization (HCV fibrosis stage vs. HCV prevalence of prisons), treatment capacity (2,000/year vs. unlimited) and treatment initiation based on sentence lengths (\u003e6 months vs. any). Scaling-up treatment by treating all incarcerated persons irrespective of their sentence length provided maximum health benefits–preventing 10,200 new cases of HCV, and 8,300 HCV-related deaths between 2019–2050; 90% deaths prevented would have occurred in the community. Compared with status quo, this strategy increased quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) by 69,700 and costs by €670 million, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €9,600/QALY. Scaling-up HCV treatment with DAAs for the entire Spanish prison population, irrespective of sentence length, is cost-effective and would reduce HCV burden.","authors":"Ozden O.

{"abstract":"Leaf traits are frequently measured in ecology to provide a ‘common currency’ for predicting how anthropogenic pressures impact ecosystem function. Here, we test whether leaf traits consistently respond to experimental treatments across 27 globally distributed grassland sites across 4 continents. We find that specific leaf area (leaf area per unit mass)—a commonly measured morphological trait inferring shifts between plant growth strategies—did not respond to up to four years of soil nutrient additions. Leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations increased in response to the addition of each respective soil nutrient. We found few significant changes in leaf traits when vertebrate herbivores were excluded in the short-term. SLA, and leaf nitrogen and potassium concentrations were positively correlated with species turnover, suggesting interspecific trait variation was a significant predictor of these traits, but not of leaf phosphorus concentration. Climatic conditions and pretreatment soil nutrient levels also accounted for significant amounts of variation in the leaf traits measured. Overall, we find that leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are not appropriate indicators of plant response to anthropogenic perturbations in grasslands. A NutNet global grassland study finds that leaf N, P and K consistently respond to soil nutrient additions, but leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are inconsistent indicators of anthropogenic perturbations.","authors":"Jennifer Firn; James M.

Two hundred fifty (157 in the exposed group and 93 controls) children were enrolled in our study and lead exposed children returned for multiple visits for measurement of blood and bone lead and chelation treatment. We demonstrated that the correlation between blood and bone lead increased with subsequent visits. We calculated the blood lead half-life for 50 patients, and found a significant (p-value \u003c 0.001) positive correlation with age. For ages 1–3 years (N = 17), the blood lead half-life was found to be 6.9 ± 4.0 days and for 3+ years it was found to be (N = 33) 19.3 ± 14.1 days. In conclusion, the turnover of lead in children is faster than in adults.

{"abstract":"The organism Caenorhabditis elegans is a performant model system for studying human biological processes and diseases, but until now all phenome data are produced as population-averaged read-outs. Monitoring of individual responses to drug treatments would however be more informative. Here, a new strategy to track different phenotypic traits of individual C. elegans nematodes throughout their full life-cycle—i.e., embryonic and post-embryonic development, until adulthood onset, differently from life-span—is presented. In an automated fashion, single worms were synchronized, isolated, and cultured from egg to adulthood in a microfluidic device, where their identity was preserved during their whole development. Several phenotypes were monitored and quantified for each animal, resulting in high-content phenome data. Specifically, the method was validated by analyzing the response of C. elegans to doxycycline, an antibiotic fairly well-known to prolong the development and activate mitochondrial stress-response pathways in different species. Interestingly, the obtained extensive single-worm phenome not only confirmed the dramatic doxycycline effect on the worm developmental delay, but more importantly revealed subtle yet severe treatment-dependent phenotypes that are representative of minority subgroups and would have otherwise stayed hidden in an averaged dataset. Such heterogeneous response started during the embryonic development, which makes essential having a dedicated chip that allows including this early developmental stage in the drug assay. Our approach would therefore allow elucidating pharmaceutical or therapeutic responses that so far were still being overlooked. A microfluidic device containing millimeter-sized, single animal chambers allows researchers to detect previously-unseen individual drug responses in Caenorhabditis elegans worms. Martin Gijs and his research group from EPFL, Switzerland, developed their system wherein individual C. elegans organisms can be cultured throughout their entire life-cycle, while preserving their individual identity. The group then validated their system by testing the animals’ responses to a drug (doxycycline) known to induce certain biological changes. Alongside the standard, expected effects experienced by the majority of the animals, the researchers were also able to detect significant individual responses, starting in early-stage worm development, that would have otherwise been overlooked in a standard population-based study. The group’s system facilitates automation, offers clear advantages over some similar, previously reported techniques, and could provide substantial benefits to the human drug discovery process.","authors":"Maria Cristina Letizia; Matteo Cornaglia; Raphaël Trouillon; Vincenzo Sorrentino; Laurent Mouchiroud; Maroun S.

{"abstract":"Macrodasyida (phylum Gastrotricha) comprises 365 species distributed across 34 genera and 10 families. However, current classification is under revision due to the contradictory results of molecular and morphological cladistic analyses. Studies aimed at bridging the gaps took advantage of supplementary assessments of poorly known species and particularly from observations of new taxa showing original traits that could help to identify plesiomorphic character states in these anatomically diverse micrometazoa. We follow this path by describing three new interesting macrodasyidan species respectively from Italy, Brazil and Sweden. In many respects, the new species resemble most closely species of the genus Macrodasys; however, details of the external morphology, in combination with the different lay-out of the reproductive system and the tiny spermatozoa lacking a visible flagellum, suggest they belong to a new genus, possibly in the family Macrodasyidae. These hypotheses are supported by the phylogenetic relationships of 47 taxa inferred from analyses of the 18S rRNA gene, which found the new species clustering with Thaidasys tongiorgii in a subset of a larger clade containing Macrodasys. Accordingly, the establishment of the following taxa is proposed: Kryptodasys gen. nov., K. marcocurinii sp. nov., K. carlosrochai sp. nov. and K. ulfjondeliusi sp. nov.","authors":"M.

{"abstract":"Unipotent spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can be efficiently reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells only by manipulating the culture condition, without introducing exogenous reprogramming factors. This phenotype raises the hypothesis that the endogenous transcription factors (TFs) in SSCs may facilitate reprogramming to acquire pluripotency. In this study, we screened a pool of SSCs TFs (Bcl6b, Lhx1, Foxo1, Plzf, Id4, Taf4b, and Etv5), and found that oncogene Etv5 could dramatically increase the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generation when combined with Yamanaka factors. We also demonstrated that Etv5 could promote mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) at the early stage of reprogramming by regulating Tet2-miR200s-Zeb1 axis. In addition, Etv5 knockdown in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) could decrease the genomic 5hmC level by downregulating Tet2. Furthermore, the embryoid body assay revealed that Etv5 could positively regulate primitive endoderm specification through regulating Gata6 and negatively regulate epiblast specification by inhibiting Fgf5 expression. In summary, our findings provide insights into understanding the regulation mechanisms of Etv5 under the context of somatic reprogramming, mESCs maintenance, and differentiation.","authors":"Jinglong Zhang; Hongxia Cao; Jing Xie; Chen Fan; Youlong Xie; Xin He; Mingzhi Liao; Shiqiang Zhang; Huayan Wang","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Life Sciences, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering \u0026 Technology, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China","title":"The oncogene Etv5 promotes MET in somatic reprogramming and orchestrates epiblast/primitive endoderm specification during mESCs differentiation","id":"88550644-a81e-4624-b4c3-23d015cae585"}
{"abstract":"The proliferative and functional heterogeneity among seemingly uniform cells is a universal phenomenon. Identifying the underlying factors requires single-cell analysis of function and proliferation. Here we show that the pancreatic beta-cells in zebrafish exhibit different growth-promoting and functional properties, which in part reflect differences in the time elapsed since birth of the cells. Calcium imaging shows that the beta-cells in the embryonic islet become functional during early zebrafish development. At later stages, younger beta-cells join the islet following differentiation from post-embryonic progenitors. Notably, the older and younger beta-cells occupy different regions within the islet, which generates topological asymmetries in glucose responsiveness and proliferation. Specifically, the older beta-cells exhibit robust glucose responsiveness, whereas younger beta-cells are more proliferative but less functional. As the islet approaches its mature state, heterogeneity diminishes and beta-cells synchronize function and proliferation. Our work illustrates a dynamic model of heterogeneity based on evolving proliferative and functional beta-cell states. Βeta-cells have recently been shown to be heterogeneous with regard to morphology and function. Here, the authors show that β-cells in zebrafish switch from proliferative to functional states with increasing time since β-cell birth, leading to functional and proliferative heterogeneity.","authors":"Sumeet Pal Singh; Sharan Janjuha; Theresa Hartmann; Özge Kayisoglu; Judith Konantz; Sarah Birke; Priyanka Murawala; Ezzaldin Ahmed Alfar; Kei Murata; Anne Eugster; Naoki Tsuji; Edward R.

{"abstract":"T lymphocytes must be produced throughout life, yet the thymus, where T lymphocytes are made, exhibits accelerated atrophy with age. Even in advanced atrophy, however, the thymus remains plastic, and can be regenerated by appropriate stimuli. Logically, thymic atrophy is thought to reflect senescent cell death, while regeneration requires proliferation of stem or progenitor cells, although evidence is scarce. Here we use conditional reporters to show that accelerated thymic atrophy reflects contraction of complex cell projections unique to cortical epithelial cells, while regeneration requires their regrowth. Both atrophy and regeneration are independent of changes in epithelial cell number, suggesting that the size of the thymus is regulated primarily by rate-limiting morphological changes in cortical stroma, rather than by their cell death or proliferation. Our data also suggest that cortical epithelial morphology is under the control of medullary stromal signals, revealing a previously unrecognized endocrine-paracrine signaling axis in the thymus. One aspect of ageing on immunity is attributed to accelerated thymic atrophy, but the underlying mechanism is still lacking. Here the authors show, using conditional reporter mouse models, that both atrophy and regeneration of the thymus are regulated by rate-limiting morphological changes in epithelial stroma, independent of cell death or proliferation.","authors":"Thomas Venables; Ann V.

{"abstract":"This is a multi-individual (n = 11), stable carbon and nitrogen isotope study of bone collagen (δ13Ccol and δ15Ncol) from the giant beaver (genus Castoroides). The now-extinct giant beaver was once one of the most widespread Pleistocene megafauna in North America. We confirm that Castoroides consumed a diet of predominantly submerged aquatic macrophytes. These dietary preferences rendered the giant beaver highly dependent on wetland habitat for survival. Castoroides’ δ13Ccol and δ15Ncol do not support the hypothesis that the giant beaver consumed trees or woody plants, which suggests that it did not share the same behaviours as Castor (i.e., tree-cutting and harvesting). The onset of warmer, more arid conditions likely contributed to the extinction of Castoroides. Six new radiocarbon dates help establish the chronology of the northward dispersal of the giant beaver in Beringia, indicating a correlation with ice sheet retreat.","authors":"Tessa Plint; Fred J.

The present study was a prospective, randomized, four-armed clinical trial, which included 1004 eyes from 1004 patients. Patients receiving IVB were randomly assigned into four groups: superotemporal (ST); superonasal (SN); inferotemporal (IT); and inferonasal (IN) injections. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. Primary study variables were the relationship between pain severity and injection site, number of previous injections, age, sex, and indication for injection. Secondary variables included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) changes 1 month post IVB. Overall mean pain score was 2.86 ± 2.2. Indications for injection were diabetic macular edema (84.1%), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (7.7%), and macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (8.2%). The mean VAS scores in the SN, IN, ST, and IT groups were 1.5 ± 1.7, 3 ± 2.3, 4 ± 2, and 3 ± 2.1, respectively. Pain severity was significantly correlated with injection site (p \u003c 0.001) and sex (p \u003c 0.001); females showed higher pain scores.

{"abstract":"We study the stability of Catalan and Spanish coexistence in Catalonia, a key political and economic European region. Recent, abundant empirical data of language use is analyzed within an analytic model of population dynamics. This model contemplates the possibilities of both long-term language coexistence and decline. The data needs to be interpreted under different circumstances. The most likely scenario, we find, is a sustained coexistence. Extreme cases still lead to the decline of one of the tongues–we delimit when this can happen. Asymptotic behavior is often an unreliable predictor in complex social systems; we make an attempt at forecasting fractions of speakers towards $$2030$$ . These also suggest sustained coexistence, but some counterintuitive dynamics are unveiled. Model parameters estimated from the data convey relevant information about the prestige and interlinguistic similarity of both tongues. We quantify these parameters rigorously for these languages for the first time. Remarkably, Spanish is found to have a larger prestige in areas which historically had larger Catalan monolingual communities. With limited, spatially-segregated data we examine more fine grained dynamics, thus better addressing the likely outcomes. Differences in model parameters across regions reveal how the two languages are perceived in more urban or rural environments.","authors":"Luís F.

{"abstract":"The fruitful association of quantum and integrated photonics holds the promise to produce, manipulate, and detect quantum states of light using compact and scalable systems. Integrating all the building blocks necessary to produce high-quality photonic entanglement in the telecom-wavelength range out of a single chip remains a major challenge, mainly due to the limited performance of on-chip light rejection filters. We report a stand-alone, telecom-compliant device that integrates, on a single substrate, a nonlinear photon-pair generator and a passive pump-rejection filter. Using standard channel-grid fiber demultiplexers, we demonstrate the first entanglement qualification of such an integrated circuit, showing the highest raw quantum interference visibility for time-energy entangled photons over two telecom-wavelength bands. Genuinely pure, maximally entangled states can therefore be generated thanks to the high-level of noise suppression obtained with the pump filter. These results will certainly further promote the development of more advanced and scalable photonic-integrated quantum systems compliant with telecommunication standards.","authors":"Dorian Oser; Sébastien Tanzilli; Florent Mazeas; Carlos Alonso-Ramos; Xavier Le Roux; Grégory Sauder; Xin Hua; Oliver Alibart; Laurent Vivien; Éric Cassan; Laurent Labonté","keywords":"Quantum information; Single photons and quantum effects","organization_affiliated":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France; Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France; Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France; Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France; Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France; Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, Institut de Physique de Nice (INPHYNI), Nice Cedex 2, France","title":"High-quality photonic entanglement out of a stand-alone silicon chip","id":"b9d83436-a01e-4ef7-997e-396b35dae650"}
{"abstract":"Rett Syndrome (RTT), which affects approximately 1:10.000 live births, is a X-linked pervasive neuro-developmental disorder which is caused, in the vast majority of cases, by a sporadic mutation in the Methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) gene. This is a transcriptional activator/repressor with presumed pleiotropic activities. The broad tissue expression of MeCP2 suggests that it may be involved in several metabolic pathways, but the molecular mechanisms which provoke the onset and progression of the syndrome are largely unknown. In this paper, we report that primary fibroblasts that have been isolated from RTT patients display a defective formation of autophagosomes under conditions of nutrient starvation and that the mature Red Blood Cells of some RTT patients retain mitochondria. Moreover, we provide evidence regarding the accumulation of the p62/SQSTM1 protein and ubiquitin-aggregated structures in the cerebellum of Mecp2 knockout mouse model (Mecp2 −/y ) during transition from the non-symptomatic to the symptomatic stage of the disease.

{"abstract":"Tissue macrophages in many adult organs originate from yolk sac (YS) progenitors, which invade the developing embryo and persist by means of local self-renewal. However, the route and characteristics of YS macrophage trafficking during embryogenesis are incompletely understood. Here we show the early migration dynamics of YS-derived macrophage progenitors in vivo using fate mapping and intravital microscopy. From embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) CX3CR1+ pre-macrophages are present in the mouse YS where they rapidly proliferate and gain access to the bloodstream to migrate towards the embryo. Trafficking of pre-macrophages and their progenitors from the YS to tissues peaks around E10.5, dramatically decreases towards E12.5 and is no longer evident from E14.5 onwards. Thus, YS progenitors use the vascular system during a restricted time window of embryogenesis to invade the growing fetus. These findings close an important gap in our understanding of the development of the innate immune system. Tissue-resident macrophages are derived from yolk sac progenitors but how and when these progenitors enter is unclear.

{"abstract":"Ca2+-activated, non-selective (CAN) ion channels sense increases of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, producing a flux of Na+ and/or K+ ions that depolarizes the cell, thus modulating cellular Ca2+ entry. CAN channels are involved in cellular responses such as neuronal bursting activity and cardiac rhythm. Here we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the most widespread CAN channel, human TRPM4, bound to the agonist Ca2+ and the modulator decavanadate. Four cytosolic C-terminal domains form an umbrella-like structure with a coiled-coil domain for the ‘pole’ and four helical ‘ribs’ spanning the N-terminal TRPM homology regions (MHRs), thus holding four subunits in a crown-like architecture. We observed two decavanadate-binding sites, one in the C-terminal domain and another in the intersubunit MHR interface. A glutamine in the selectivity filter may be an important determinant of monovalent selectivity. Our structure provides new insights into the function and pharmacology of both the CAN and the TRPM families. The structure of the Ca2+-activated, non-selective ion channel TRPM4 bound to the agonist Ca2+ and a modulator decavanadate, solved using electron cryo-microscopy. Melastatin-related transient receptor potential (TRPM) ion channels are the largest group of the TRP superfamily and, as such, are widespread throughout the body with diverse physiological roles including heat and taste sensation and regulating ion homeostasis. For example, TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated non-selective channel expressed in many of the central organs including the brain and heart, and is involved in the cardiac rhythm, breath pacemaking and insulin secretion. In this issue of Nature, two groups report the structure of TRPM4 by electron cryo-microscopy. Wei Lü and colleagues solved the structure of human TRPM4, which shows an umbrella-like structure, bound to Ca(ɪɪ) and decavanadate. Youxing Jiang and colleagues report the structure of mouse TRPM4 with and without ATP, which inhibits channel activity. These studies provide the first structural insights into the TRPM family.","authors":"Paige A.

{"abstract":"To assess the efficacy of combined 5FU and Avastin injections in the treatment of primary pterygium Sixteen eyes with primary pterygium received intralesional 5 fluorouracil and Avastin (2.5–5 mg) injections every 2 weeks for a maximum of five injections. Fourteen eyes of 14 patients received five injections, one eye received three injections and one eye received two injections. All eyes were followed at monthly intervals for 3 months after last injection. Tissue was obtained by surgical excision of primary pterygium from four eyes who received injections and three eyes with primary pterygium who did not receive injections (control) and subjected to immunohistological examination for beta fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), von-Willebrand factor (vWF), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1) and collagen-I. Pterygium progression was arrested in all patients. Sixty-two percent of patients had improvement of redness while 89% had reduced thickness of the lesion. VEGF, bFGF, EGF, vWF, LYVE-1 and collagen-I were all reduced in the injected samples. The injection of 5 fluorouracil and Avastin act synergistically to arrest progression and induce atrophy in primary pterygium. This is related to the effect of agents on fibroblasts, collagen, and vascular tissues. Such medical intervention is a safe and viable option in the management of primary pterygium though excision of residual tissue is still required in some cases. Longer follow up is needed to ascertain whether this will reduce the recurrence rate following excision.","authors":"Noha Ghoz; John Britton; Andrew R. Ross; Imran Mohammed; Emily Hogan; Dalia G.

{"abstract":"The derivation of kidney tissues from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and its application for replacement therapy in end-stage renal disease have been widely discussed. Here we report that consecutive transfections of two sets of synthetic mRNAs encoding transcription factors can induce rapid and efficient differentiation of hPSCs into kidney tissues, termed induced nephron-like organoids (iNephLOs). The first set - FIGLA, PITX2, ASCL1 and TFAP2C, differentiated hPSCs into SIX2+SALL1+ nephron progenitor cells with 92% efficiency within 2 days. Subsequently, the second set - HNF1A, GATA3, GATA1 and EMX2, differentiated these cells into PAX8+LHX1+ pretubular aggregates in another 2 days. Further culture in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional conditions produced iNephLOs containing cells characterized as podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules in an additional 10 days. Global gene expression profiles showed similarities between iNephLOs and the human adult kidney, suggesting possible uses of iNephLOs as in vitro models for kidneys.","authors":"Ken Hiratsuka; Toshiaki Monkawa; Tomohiko Akiyama; Yuhki Nakatake; Mayumi Oda; Sravan Kumar Goparaju; Hiromi Kimura; Nana Chikazawa-Nohtomi; Saeko Sato; Keiichiro Ishiguro; Shintaro Yamaguchi; Sayuri Suzuki; Ryuji Morizane; Shigeru B.

{"abstract":"The Maniq and Mlabri are the only recorded nomadic hunter-gatherer groups in Thailand. Here, we sequenced complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes and ~2.364 Mbp of non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY) to learn more about the origins of these two enigmatic populations. Both groups exhibited low genetic diversity compared to other Thai populations, and contrasting patterns of mtDNA and NRY diversity: there was greater mtDNA diversity in the Maniq than in the Mlabri, while the converse was true for the NRY. We found basal uniparental lineages in the Maniq, namely mtDNA haplogroups M21a, R21 and M17a, and NRY haplogroup K. Overall, the Maniq are genetically similar to other negrito groups in Southeast Asia. By contrast, the Mlabri haplogroups (B5a1b1 for mtDNA and O1b1a1a1b and O1b1a1a1b1a1 for the NRY) are common lineages in Southeast Asian non-negrito groups, and overall the Mlabri are genetically similar to their linguistic relatives (Htin and Khmu) and other groups from northeastern Thailand. In agreement with previous studies of the Mlabri, our results indicate that the Malbri do not directly descend from the indigenous negritos. Instead, they likely have a recent origin (within the past 1,000 years) by an extreme founder event (involving just one maternal and two paternal lineages) from an agricultural group, most likely the Htin or a closely-related group.","authors":"Wibhu Kutanan; Jatupol Kampuansai; Piya Changmai; Pavel Flegontov; Roland Schröder; Enrico Macholdt; Alexander Hübner; Daoroong Kangwanpong; Mark Stoneking","keywords":"Genetic variation","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Bioresources for Agriculture, Industry and Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Science, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic; Department of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Science, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic; Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, České, Budějovice, Czech Republic; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany","title":"Contrasting maternal and paternal genetic variation of hunter-gatherer groups in Thailand","id":"03a727b1-592c-498f-a185-a03d660cfbff"}
{"abstract":"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a major element involved in apple (Malus domestica) production because of its role in seed germination and early seedling development. The WRKY family, which is one of the largest families of transcription factors, plays an important role in ABA signaling in plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of WRKY-mediated ABA sensitivity in apple are poorly understood. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis indicated that MdWRKY31 is a key factor induced by ABA. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that MdWRKY31 is induced by ABA in response to PEG4000, which is used to simulate drought. As a transcription factor, MdWRKY31 is localized in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of MdWRKY31 in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced plant sensitivity to ABA. Overexpression of MdWRKY31 in apple roots and apple calli increased sensitivity to ABA, whereas repression of MdWRKY31 reduced sensitivity to ABA in the roots of ‘Royal Gala’. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR, and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that MdWRKY31 directly binds to the promoter of MdRAV1. Expression analyses of transgenic apple calli containing MdWRKY31 and pMdRAV1::GUS implied that MdWRKY31 represses the expression of MdRAV1. We also found that MdRAV1 binds directly to the promoters of MdABI3 and MdABI4 and repressed their expression. Our findings reveal a new important regulatory mechanism of MdWRKY31-MdRAV1-MdABIs in the ABA signaling pathway in apple.","authors":"Xian-Yan Zhao; Chen-Hui Qi; Han Jiang; Chun-Xiang You; Qing-Mei Guan; Feng-Wang Ma; Yuan-Yuan Li; Yu-Jin Hao","keywords":"Plant signalling; Transcriptional regulatory elements","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas/Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Apple, College of Horticulture, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Horticulture Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai-An, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas/Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Apple, College of Horticulture, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Horticulture Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai-An, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas/Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Apple, College of Horticulture, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas/Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Apple, College of Horticulture, Northwest A\u0026F University, Yangling, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Horticulture Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai-An, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Horticulture Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai-An, China","title":"The MdWRKY31 transcription factor binds to the MdRAV1 promoter to mediate ABA sensitivity","id":"de29c98a-3387-4457-b8e5-4ef40341bfbf"}
{"abstract":"Hypoparathyroidism remains one of the most common complications in thyroid surgery. This study aims for an improved understanding of the complexity of the blood supply and the localisation of the parathyroids compared to the two most important intraoperative landmarks: the inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) and Zuckerkandl’s tubercle (ZT). We examined 103 laryngeal compounds to classify the blood supply and the localisation of the parathyroids. For intraoperative localisation we defined a Cartesian coordinate system with the ZT plane as x-axis and the course of the inferior laryngeal nerve as y-axis. The inferior thyroid artery (ITA) mainly supplies the parathyroids, whereas the superior thyroid artery provides a backup supply. It must be pointed out that 8.2% of parathyroids receive their blood directly from the thyroid gland. 73.5% of all parathyroids lie within 1 cm of the ILN and 1 cm cranial and 2.5 cm caudal to the ZT plane. Our described perimeters mark the most crucial areas during surgery and provide the surgeon with an anatomic mapping showing areas of special carefulness needed.

{"abstract":"During translation termination in bacteria, the release factors RF1 and RF2 are recycled from the ribosome by RF3. While high-resolution structures of the individual termination factors on the ribosome exist, direct structural insight into how RF3 mediates dissociation of the decoding RFs has been lacking. Here we have used the Apidaecin 137 peptide to trap RF1 together with RF3 on the ribosome and visualize an ensemble of termination intermediates using cryo-electron microscopy. Binding of RF3 to the ribosome induces small subunit (SSU) rotation and swivelling of the head, yielding intermediate states with shifted P-site tRNAs and RF1 conformations. RF3 does not directly eject RF1 from the ribosome, but rather induces full rotation of the SSU that indirectly dislodges RF1 from its binding site. SSU rotation is coupled to the accommodation of the GTPase domain of RF3 on the large subunit (LSU), thereby promoting GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of RF3 from the ribosome. In bacteria, the process of translation termination is performed by three termination release factors RF1, RF2 and RF3. Here the authors provide detailed structural insights into the mechanism by which RF1 is dissociated from the ribosome by RF3 during termination.","authors":"Michael Graf; Paul Huter; Cristina Maracci; Miroslav Peterek; Marina V.

{"abstract":"Blight-resistant rice lines are the most effective solution for bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Key resistance mechanisms involve SWEET genes as susceptibility factors. Bacterial transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors bind to effector-binding elements (EBEs) in SWEET gene promoters and induce SWEET genes. EBE variants that cannot be recognized by TAL effectors abrogate induction, causing resistance. Here we describe a diagnostic kit to enable analysis of bacterial blight in the field and identification of suitable resistant lines. Specifically, we include a SWEET promoter database, RT–PCR primers for detecting SWEET induction, engineered reporter rice lines to visualize SWEET protein accumulation and knock-out rice lines to identify virulence mechanisms in bacterial isolates. We also developed CRISPR–Cas9 genome-edited Kitaake rice to evaluate the efficacy of EBE mutations in resistance, software to predict the optimal resistance gene set for a specific geographic region, and two resistant ‘mega’ rice lines that will empower farmers to plant lines that are most likely to resist rice blight. Strategic deployment of blight-resistant rice lines is enabled by a molecular diagnostic kit.","authors":"Joon-Seob Eom; Dangping Luo; Genelou Atienza-Grande; Jungil Yang; Chonghui Ji; Van Thi Luu; José C.

{"abstract":"Mixed-valent transition metal compounds display complex structural, electronic and magnetic properties which can often be exquisitely tuned. Here the charge-ordered state of stoichiometric CaFe3O5 is probed using neutron powder diffraction, Monte Carlo simulation and symmetry analysis. Magnetic ordering is dominated by the formation of ferromagnetic Fe3+–Fe2+–Fe3+ trimers which are evident above the magnetic ordering transition. Between TN = 289 K and 281 K an incommensurate magnetically ordered phase develops due to magnetic frustration, but a spin Jahn-Teller distortion lifts the frustration and enables the magnetic ordering to lock in to a charge-ordered commensurate state at lower temperatures. Stoichiometric CaFe3O5 exhibits single phase behaviour throughout and avoids the phase separation into two distinct crystallographic phases with different magnetic structures and Fe valence distributions reported recently, which likely occurs due to partial Fe2+ for Ca2+ substitution. This underlines the sensitivity of the magnetism and chemistry of these mixed-valent systems to composition. A significant challenge in understanding the behaviour of strongly correlated materials is their sensitivity to composition. Here the authors show that stoichiometric CaFe3O5 avoids the electronic phase separation reported in a non-stoichiometric sample, and also exhibits an incommensurate magnetic phase.","authors":"Simon J.

In addition, we use single cell RNA-seq to create a high resolution gene expression atlas of the developing wild type mouse uterus. Cell types and subtypes are defined, for example dividing endothelial cells into arterial, venous, capillary, and lymphatic, while epithelial cells separate into luminal and glandular subtypes. Further, a surprising heterogeneity of stromal and myocyte cell types are identified. Transcription factor codes and ligand/receptor interactions are characterized. We also used single cell RNA-seq to globally define the altered gene expression patterns in all developing uterus cell types for two Hox mutants, with 8 or 9 mutant Hox genes.

{"abstract":"Selective recruitment and concentration of signalling proteins within membraneless compartments is a ubiquitous mechanism for subcellular organization1–3. The dynamic flow of molecules into and out of these compartments occurs on faster timescales than for membrane-enclosed organelles, presenting a possible mechanism to control spatial patterning within cells. Here, we combine single-molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy, light-induced subcellular localization, reaction-diffusion modelling and a spatially resolved promoter activation assay to study signal exchange in and out of the 200 nm cytoplasmic pole-organizing protein popZ (PopZ) microdomain at the cell pole of the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus4–8. Two phospho-signalling proteins, the transmembrane histidine kinase CckA and the cytoplasmic phosphotransferase ChpT, provide the only phosphate source for the cell fate-determining transcription factor CtrA9–18. We find that all three proteins exhibit restricted rates of entry into and escape from the microdomain as well as enhanced phospho-signalling within, leading to a submicron gradient of activated CtrA-P19 that is stable and sublinear. Entry into the microdomain is selective for cytosolic proteins and requires a binding pathway to PopZ. Our work demonstrates how nanoscale protein assemblies can modulate signal propagation with fine spatial resolution, and that in Caulobacter, this modulation serves to reinforce asymmetry and differential cell fate of the two daughter cells. In an interesting demonstration of how bacterial subcellular organization influences physiology, polar accumulation of PopZ protein in a membraneless microdomain is found to drive asymmetric phosphorylation of CtrA-P, which creates a gradient that is responsible for asymmetric cell division in Caulobacter.","authors":"Keren Lasker; Lexy von Diezmann; Xiaofeng Zhou; Daniel G.

{"abstract":"The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is essential for intestinal epithelium homeostasis, but its aberrant activation is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). Several studies indicate that the bioactive vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) inhibits proliferation and promotes epithelial differentiation of colon carcinoma cells in part through antagonism of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. It is now accepted that stromal fibroblasts are crucial in healthy and pathologic intestine: pericryptal myofibroblasts are constituents of the stem cell niche and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to CRC progression. However, studies on the combined action of 1,25(OH)2D3 and Wnt factors in colon fibroblasts are lacking. Here we show by global transcriptomic studies that 1,25(OH)2D3 and Wnt3A have profound, additive, partially overlapping effects on the gene expression profile of CCD-18Co human colon myofibroblasts. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 and Wnt3A inhibit CCD-18Co cell proliferation and migration, while 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces, but Wnt3A increases, their capacity to contract collagen gels (a marker of fibroblast activation). These data were largely confirmed in patient-derived primary colon normal fibroblasts and CAFs, and in fibroblasts from other origins. Our results indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 and Wnt3A are strong regulators of colon fibroblast biology and contribute to a better knowledge of intestinal homeostasis and stromal fibroblast action in CRC.","authors":"Gemma Ferrer-Mayorga; Núria Niell; Ramón Cantero; José Manuel González-Sancho; Luis del Peso; Alberto Muñoz; María Jesús Larriba","keywords":"Cancer microenvironment; Cell growth; Cell migration; Nuclear receptors; Transcriptomics","organization_affiliated":"Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Bioquímica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; Servicio de Cirugía General, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Bioquímica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Bioquímica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; CIBERES, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols”, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain","title":"Vitamin D and Wnt3A have additive and partially overlapping modulatory effects on gene expression and phenotype in human colon fibroblasts","id":"be029dc8-5dd3-41b2-98eb-21b415a0eb41"}
{"abstract":"Perturbations in ribosome biogenesis have been associated with cancer. Such aberrations activate p53 through the RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA complex-mediated inhibition of HDM2. Studies using animal models have suggested that this signaling pathway might constitute an important anticancer barrier. To gain a deeper insight into this issue in humans, here we analyze somatic mutations in RPL5 and RPL11 coding regions, reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases. Using a combined computational and statistical approach, complemented by a range of biochemical and functional analyses in human cancer cell models, we demonstrate the existence of several mechanisms by which RPL5 mutations may impair wild-type p53 upregulation and ribosome biogenesis. Unexpectedly, the same approach provides only modest evidence for a similar role of RPL11, suggesting that RPL5 represents a preferred target during human tumorigenesis in cancers with wild-type p53. Furthermore, we find that several functional cancer-associated RPL5 somatic mutations occur as rare germline variants in general population. Our results shed light on the so-far enigmatic role of cancer-associated mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins, with implications for our understanding of the tumor suppressive role of the RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA complex in human malignancies.","authors":"Ines Oršolić; Slađana Bursać; Deana Jurada; Irena Drmić Hofman; Zlatko Dembić; Jiri Bartek; Ivana Mihalek; Siniša Volarević","keywords":"Cancer genetics; Mechanisms of disease; Stress signalling","organization_affiliated":"Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia; Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia; Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia; Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia; Institute for Oral Biology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Division of Genome Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; The Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia; Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia","title":"Cancer-associated mutations in the ribosomal protein L5 gene dysregulate the HDM2/p53-mediated ribosome biogenesis checkpoint","id":"de4fb809-7f74-4af8-97d6-1a0dbc5fbb21"}
{"abstract":"Spatial attention and expectation are two critical top-down mechanisms controlling perceptual inference. Based on previous research it remains unclear whether their influence on perceptual decisions is additive or interactive. We developed a novel multisensory approach that orthogonally manipulated spatial attention (i.e. task-relevance) and expectation (i.e. signal probability) selectively in audition and evaluated their effects on observers’ responses in vision. Critically, while experiment 1 manipulated expectation directly via the probability of task-relevant auditory targets across hemifields, experiment 2 manipulated it indirectly via task-irrelevant auditory non-targets. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that spatial attention and signal probability influence perceptual decisions either additively or interactively. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained parsimoniously by a model that combines spatial attention, general and spatially selective response probabilities as predictors with no direct influence of signal probability. Our model provides a novel perspective on how spatial attention and expectation facilitate effective interactions with the environment.","authors":"Arianna Zuanazzi; Uta Noppeney","keywords":"Attention; Human behaviour","organization_affiliated":"Computational Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory, Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics Centre, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Computational Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory, Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics Centre, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK","title":"Additive and interactive effects of spatial attention and expectation on perceptual decisions","id":"99c74e3d-dbd5-43ce-ae00-d4bb2049fb40"}
{"abstract":"Nanofiltration (NF) membranes with ultrahigh permeance and high rejection are highly beneficial for efficient desalination and wastewater treatment. Improving water permeance while maintaining the high rejection of state-of-the-art thin film composite (TFC) NF membranes remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of a TFC NF membrane with a crumpled polyamide (PA) layer via interfacial polymerization on a single-walled carbon nanotubes/polyether sulfone composite support loaded with nanoparticles as a sacrificial templating material, using metal-organic framework nanoparticles (ZIF-8) as an example. The nanoparticles, which can be removed by water dissolution after interfacial polymerization, facilitate the formation of a rough PA active layer with crumpled nanostructure. The NF membrane obtained thereby exhibits high permeance up to 53.5 l m−2h−1 bar−1 with a rejection above 95% for Na2SO4, yielding an overall desalination performance superior to state-of-the-art NF membranes reported so far. Our work provides a simple avenue to fabricate advanced PA NF membranes with outstanding performance. Nanofiltration membranes are important for water desalination technologies, but designing membranes that achieve both high permeance and high salt rejection remains challenging. Here, the authors use sacrificial nanoparticles in the membrane fabrication process, leading to crumpled structures with ultrahigh permeance.","authors":"Zhenyi Wang; Zhangxin Wang; Shihong Lin; Huile Jin; Shoujian Gao; Yuzhang Zhu; Jian Jin","keywords":"Chemical engineering; Environmental chemistry; Metal–organic frameworks; Polymers","organization_affiliated":"i-Lab, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, and CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China; College of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, China; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA; College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering, Wenzhou University Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; i-Lab, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, and CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China; i-Lab, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, and CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China; i-Lab, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, and CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China","title":"Nanoparticle-templated nanofiltration membranes for ultrahigh performance desalination","id":"400a5b00-2aa0-494d-802a-427d60625198"}
{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological differences among three advanced guided technologies in adult degenerative scoliosis. A total of 1012 pedicle screws were inserted in 83 patients using a spine robot (group A), 886 screws were implanted in 75 patients using a drill guide template (group B), and 1276 screws were inserted in 109 patients using CT-based navigation (group C). Screw positions were evaluated using postoperative CT scans according to the Gertzbein and Robbins classification. Other relevant data were also collected. Perfect pedicle screw insertion (Grade A) accuracy in groups A, B, and C was 91.3%, 81.3%, and 84.1%, respectively. Clinically acceptable accuracy of screw implantation (Grades A + B) respectively was 96.0%, 90.6%, and 93.0%. Statistical analysis showed the perfect and clinically acceptable accuracy in group A was significant different compared with groups B and C. Group A exhibited the lowest intra-op radiation dose and group B showed the shortest surgical time compared with the other two groups.

{"abstract":"Previous studies suggested that the IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor signaling pathway may contribute to regulate uric acid levels. To confirm this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of the IGF-1-raising genetic variant rs35767 on urate levels in serum and urine, and we investigated IGF-1 ability to modulate the expression of transporters involved in reabsorption and secretion of uric acid in the kidney. The study population included 2794 adult Whites. 24-hour urinary uric acid concentration was available for 229 subjects. rs35767 polymorphism was screened using TaqMan genotyping assays. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney-293) cell line was treated with IGF-1 (1, 5, 10, 50 nM) for 24-hours, and differences in the expression of urate transporters were evaluated via Western Blot and real time rtPCR. Individuals carrying the IGF-1-raising allele (rs35767 T) exhibited significantly lower levels of serum urate according to both additive and recessive models, after correction for gender, age, BMI, glucose tolerance, glomerular filtration rate, and anti-hypertensive treatment. TT genotype carriers displayed higher uricosuria than C allele carriers did, after adjusting for confounders. Exposure of HEK293 cells to IGF-1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of uric acid transporters deputed to uric acid excretion (MRP4, NPT1 and BCRP), and reduction of GLUT9 expression, the major mediator of uric acid reabsorption, both at mRNA and protein level. We observed a significant association between the functional polymorphism rs35767 near IGF1 with serum urate concentrations and we provide a mechanistic explanation supporting a causal role for IGF-1 in the regulation of uric acid homeostasis.","authors":"Gaia C.

{"abstract":"Previously, we isolated 84 deletion mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae auxotrophic background that exhibited hypersensitive growth under high hydrostatic pressure and/or low temperature. Here, we observed that 24 deletion mutants were rescued by the introduction of four plasmids (LEU2, HIS3, LYS2, and URA3) together to grow at 25 MPa, thereby suggesting close links between the genes and nutrient uptake. Most of the highly ranked genes were poorly characterized, including MAY24/YPR153W. May24 appeared to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Therefore, we designated this gene as EHG (ER-associated high-pressure growth gene) 1. Deletion of EHG1 led to reduced nutrient transport rates and decreases in the nutrient permease levels at 25 MPa. These results suggest that Ehg1 is required for the stability and functionality of the permeases under high pressure. Ehg1 physically interacted with nutrient permeases Hip1, Bap2, and Fur4; however, alanine substitutions for Pro17, Phe19, and Pro20, which were highly conserved among Ehg1 homologues in various yeast species, eliminated interactions with the permeases as well as the high-pressure growth ability. By functioning as a novel chaperone that facilitated coping with high-pressure-induced perturbations, Ehg1 could exert a stabilizing effect on nutrient permeases when they are present in the ER.","authors":"Goyu Kurosaka; Satoshi Uemura; Takahiro Mochizuki; Yuri Kozaki; Akiko Hozumi; Sayuri Suwa; Ryoga Ishii; Yusuke Kato; Saki Imura; Natsuho Ishida; Yoichi Noda; Fumiyoshi Abe","keywords":"Cell growth; Cellular microbiology; Molecular biology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Division of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan; Collaborative Research Institute for Innovative Microbiology, Department of Biotechnology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, Sagamihara, Japan","title":"A novel ER membrane protein Ehg1/May24 plays a critical role in maintaining multiple nutrient permeases in yeast under high-pressure perturbation","id":"b86fd339-ad51-481f-92e7-c751bd3a1dc2"}

{"abstract":"In contrast to the plasma membrane, the vacuole membrane has not yet been associated with electrical excitation of plants. Here, we show that mesophyll vacuoles from Arabidopsis sense and control the membrane potential essentially via the K+-permeable TPC1 and TPK channels. Electrical stimuli elicit transient depolarization of the vacuole membrane that can last for seconds. Electrical excitability is suppressed by increased vacuolar Ca2+ levels. In comparison to wild type, vacuoles from the fou2 mutant, harboring TPC1 channels insensitive to luminal Ca2+, can be excited fully by even weak electrical stimuli. The TPC1-loss-of-function mutant tpc1-2 does not respond to electrical stimulation at all, and the loss of TPK1/TPK3-mediated K+ transport affects the duration of TPC1-dependent membrane depolarization. In combination with mathematical modeling, these results show that the vacuolar K+-conducting TPC1 and TPK1/TPK3 channels act in concert to provide for Ca2+- and voltage-induced electrical excitability to the central organelle of plant cells. Electrical excitability in animals and plants is associated with voltage-gated Shaker-type K+ channels at the plasma membrane. Here, Jaślan et al. show that electrical excitability of the central organelle of plant cells, the vacuole, is based on the action of Ca2+-activated and K+-conducting TPC1 and TPK channels.","authors":"Dawid Jaślan; Ingo Dreyer; Jinping Lu; Ronan O’Malley; Julian Dindas; Irene Marten; Rainer Hedrich","keywords":"Biophysics; Plant signalling","organization_affiliated":"Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Centro de Bioinformática y Simulación Molecular (CBSM), Universidad de Talca, Talca, Chile; Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, USA; DOE Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, USA; Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany; Zoology Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","title":"Voltage-dependent gating of SV channel TPC1 confers vacuole excitability","id":"f82b6569-25c0-409f-a476-ac55bf23ca0f"}
{"abstract":"Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide show remarkable antitumor activity in multiple myeloma (MM) via directly inhibiting MM-cell growth in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and promoting immune effector cell function. They are known to bind to the ubiquitin 3 ligase CRBN complex and thereby triggering degradation of IKZF1/3. In this study, we demonstrate that IMiDs also directly bind and activate zeta-chain-associated protein kinase-70 (Zap-70) via its tyrosine residue phosphorylation in T cells. IMiDs also triggered phosphorylation of Zap-70 in natural killer (NK) cells. Importantly, increased granzyme-B (GZM-B) expression and NK-cell activity triggered by IMiDs is associated with Zap-70 activation and inhibited by Zap-70 knockdown (KD), independent of CRBN. We also demonstrate a second mechanism whereby IMiDs trigger GZM-B and NK cytotoxicity which is CRBN and IKZF3 mediated, and inhibited or enhanced by KD of CRBN or IKZF3, respectively, independent of Zap-70. Our studies therefore show that IMiDs can enhance NK and T-cell cytotoxicity in (1) ZAP-70-mediated CRBN independent, as well as (2) CRBN-mediated ZAP-70 independent mechanisms; and provide the framework for developing novel therapeutics to activate Zap-70 and thereby enhance T and NK anti-MM cytotoxicity.","authors":"Teru Hideshima; Daisuke Ogiya; Jiye Liu; Takeshi Harada; Keiji Kurata; Jooeun Bae; Walter Massefski; Kenneth C.

Here, we present a mesoscopic structure composed of an array of nanoscale holes in a gold film which is designed using transformation optics and delivers ultrashort chirped electromagnetic wave packets upon 30–200 keV electron irradiation. The femtosecond photon bunches result from coherent scattering of surface plasmon polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion. They decay by radiation in a broad spectral band which is focused into a 1.5 micrometer beam waist. The focusing ability and broadband nature of this photon source will initiate applications in ultrafast spectral interferometry techniques.

{"abstract":"NMR approaches are used to probe cotranslational folding of a nascent polypeptide with two domains in Escherichia coli. The work reveals that interactions with the ribosome inhibit acquisition of the native fold by the nascent chain. Although detailed pictures of ribosome structures are emerging, little is known about the structural and cotranslational folding properties of nascent polypeptide chains at the atomic level. Here we used solution-state NMR spectroscopy to define a structural ensemble of a ribosome–nascent chain complex (RNC) formed during protein biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, in which a pair of immunoglobulin-like domains adopts a folded N-terminal domain (FLN5) and a disordered but compact C-terminal domain (FLN6). To study how FLN5 acquires its native structure cotranslationally, we progressively shortened the RNC constructs. We found that the ribosome modulates the folding process, because the complete sequence of FLN5 emerged well beyond the tunnel before acquiring native structure, whereas FLN5 in isolation folded spontaneously, even when truncated. This finding suggests that regulating structure acquisition during biosynthesis can reduce the probability of misfolding, particularly of homologous domains.","authors":"Lisa D Cabrita; Anaïs M E Cassaignau; Hélène M M Launay; Christopher A Waudby; Tomasz Wlodarski; Carlo Camilloni; Maria-Evangelia Karyadi; Amy L Robertson; Xiaolin Wang; Anne S Wentink; Luke S Goodsell; Cheryl A Woolhead; Michele Vendruscolo; Christopher M Dobson; John Christodoulou","keywords":"Protein folding; Ribosome; Solution-state NMR","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK; Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK; Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK","title":"A structural ensemble of a ribosome–nascent chain complex during cotranslational protein folding","id":"962643b9-437c-453c-b160-458b1e4653ef"}
{"abstract":"Heat shock drives the expression of transcripts that bypass mRNA quality control for direct export and translation, allowing cells to survive extreme situations at the cost of accuracy. Under normal conditions, newly made messenger RNAs are bound by adapter proteins and then the export protein Mex67, before being transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Heike Krebber and colleagues find that the pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is abbreviated under heat-shock conditions, when translation is shifted in favour of a subset of proteins—heat-shock proteins. The authors show that these proteins bypass adapter binding and quality control mechanisms to immediately recruit Mex67. This facilitates a rapid export of these transcripts to where they can be translated, and protect the cell from stress. Cells grow well only in a narrow range of physiological conditions. Surviving extreme conditions requires the instantaneous expression of chaperones that help to overcome stressful situations. To ensure the preferential synthesis of these heat-shock proteins, cells inhibit transcription, pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export of non-heat-shock transcripts, while stress-specific mRNAs are exclusively exported and translated1. How cells manage the selective retention of regular transcripts and the simultaneous rapid export of heat-shock mRNAs is largely unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling RNA adaptor proteins Npl3, Gbp2, Hrb1 and Nab2 are loaded co-transcriptionally onto growing pre-mRNAs. For nuclear export, they recruit the export-receptor heterodimer Mex67–Mtr2 (TAP–p15 in humans)2. Here we show that cellular stress induces the dissociation of Mex67 and its adaptor proteins from regular mRNAs to prevent general mRNA export. At the same time, heat-shock mRNAs are rapidly exported in association with Mex67, without the need for adapters. The immediate co-transcriptional loading of Mex67 onto heat-shock mRNAs involves Hsf1, a heat-shock transcription factor that binds to heat-shock-promoter elements in stress-responsive genes. An important difference between the export modes is that adaptor-protein-bound mRNAs undergo quality control, whereas stress-specific transcripts do not. In fact, regular mRNAs are converted into uncontrolled stress-responsive transcripts if expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter, suggesting that whether an mRNA undergoes quality control is encrypted therein. Under normal conditions, Mex67 adaptor proteins are recruited for RNA surveillance, with only quality-controlled mRNAs allowed to associate with Mex67 and leave the nucleus. Thus, at the cost of error-free mRNA formation, heat-shock mRNAs are exported and translated without delay, allowing cells to survive extreme situations.","authors":"Gesa Zander; Alexandra Hackmann; Lysann Bender; Daniel Becker; Thomas Lingner; Gabriela Salinas; Heike Krebber","keywords":"Cell biology; RNA transport","organization_affiliated":"Abteilung für Molekulare Genetik, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Genetik, Göttinger Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Abteilung für Molekulare Genetik, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Genetik, Göttinger Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Abteilung für Molekulare Genetik, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Genetik, Göttinger Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Abteilung für Molekulare Genetik, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Genetik, Göttinger Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Transkriptomanalyselabor, Institut für Entwicklungsbiochemie, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Transkriptomanalyselabor, Institut für Entwicklungsbiochemie, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany; Abteilung für Molekulare Genetik, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Genetik, Göttinger Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany","title":"mRNA quality control is bypassed for immediate export of stress-responsive transcripts","id":"6fce5a9b-9494-4a39-a77a-5e7ecf27d883"}

Clinical practice changes in the guideline included: increasing operating room temperatures, obtaining a 10-min axillary temperature, using an exothermic mattress for all infants \u003c35 weeks, and using a polyethylene wrap for infants \u003c32 weeks. The baseline rate of hypothermia (\u003c36.5 °CC) was 63%. Three PDSA cycles data were completed on 168 consecutive preterm births. The post-implementation rate of hypothermia (\u003c36.5 °C) was reduced to 30% (P\u003c0.001). The incidence of moderate hypothermia (\u003c 36 °C) was reduced from a baseline of 29% to a rate of 9% (P\u003c0.001). Use of a multidisciplinary guideline to increase preterm NICU admission temperatures resulted in a decrease in hypothermic infants.","authors":"M W Harer; B Vergales; T Cady; A Early; C Chisholm; J R Swanson","keywords":"Health services; Preterm birth","organization_affiliated":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; 4Current address: Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA., ; Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville","title":"Implementation of a multidisciplinary guideline improves preterm infant admission temperatures","id":"385e425e-79a1-4332-8528-a2e544a043d2"}
{"abstract":"Preclinical studies show that the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is involved in the reinstatement of drug seeking and motivation for drugs of abuse. A D3R gene variant, Ser9Gly (rs6280) has been linked to nicotine dependence, yet the mechanisms underlying its involvement in nicotine dependence is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between the Ser9Gly variant and measures of both nicotine reinforcement and cue-elicited craving. Phenotypes of smoking behaviors were assessed in genetically grouped (Glycine vs. No Glycine carriers) current smokers (n = 104, ≥ 10 cigarettes per day). Laboratory measures included a forced choice session (to measure reinforcement of nicotine containing vs. denicotinized cigarettes), and a cue-reactivity session (to measure smoking cues vs. neutral cues elicited craving). The forced choice procedure revealed that subjective ratings were significantly higher in response to nicotinized compared to denicotinized cigarettes; however the Ser9Gly variant did not influence this effect. By comparison, smoking cues elicited greater craving over time compared to neutral cues, and Glycine carriers of the Ser9Gly D3R variant seem to experience a significant blunted cue-elicited craving effect. Results support D3R involvement in nicotine cue reactivity. However, more research is needed to reveal how this gene variant modulates various aspects of nicotine dependence.","authors":"Chidera C.

{"abstract":"Management of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global health problem. Persistence of stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) during HBV replication is responsible for modest curative efficacy of currently licensed drugs. Novel gene editing technologies, such as those based on CRISPR/Cas9, provide the means for permanently disabling cccDNA. However, efficient delivery of antiviral sequences to infected hepatocytes is challenging. A limiting factor is the large size of sequences encoding Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, and resultant incompatibility with the popular single stranded adeno-associated viral vectors (ssAAVs). We thus explored the utility of ssAAVs for delivery of engineered CRISPR/Cas9 of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), which is encoded by shorter DNA sequences. Short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed with cognates in the S open reading frame of HBV and incorporated into AAVs that also encoded SaCas9. Intended targeted mutation of HBV DNA was observed after transduction of cells with the all-in-one vectors. Efficacy against HBV-infected hNTCP-HepG2 cells indicated that inactivation of cccDNA was successful. Analysis of likely off-target mutagenesis revealed no unintended sequence changes. Use of ssAAVs to deliver all components required to disable cccDNA by SaCas9 is novel and the technology has curative potential for HBV infection.","authors":"Tristan Scott; Buhle Moyo; Samantha Nicholson; Mohube Betty Maepa; Koichi Watashi; Abdullah Ely; Marc S.

The study sought to determine nutritional factors that could be associated with distribution of Mopani worms in these two districts. Ten sampling points in undisturbed Mopani woodlands were established in each district. Samples were collected and analysed in the lab to determine the levels of crude protein, tannin and natural detergent fibres levels in leaves and pH, Nitrates, Phosphates and Potassium levels in soil and Welch’s test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Analysis of Variance and the Bonferroni Confidence Intervals were employed to test for significance in the observed differences. Findings showed differences in tree size and leaf length whilst the differences of all other variables (non-extractible tannis, extractible tannis crude protein levels and natural detergent fibres) relating to leaf sample analysis were not statistically significant. Findings on soil sample analysis pointed out that Gwanda had higher pH, Phosphorus and Potassium levels whilst Nitrates were significantly higher in Tsholotsho. Differences in the tree sizes and leaf sizes of the samples from the two sites show that there could be host selection based on these variables.","authors":"Wilfred Njabulo Nunu; Buhlebenkosi Ncube; Oliver Dube; Clever Mpofu; Brighton Ndlovu; Tariro Dzinomwa; Nkosana Khumalo","keywords":"Ecosystem ecology; Socioeconomic scenarios","organization_affiliated":"Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Scientific Agriculture and Environment Development Institute, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Scientific Agriculture and Environment Development Institute, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Midlands State University, Gweru, Zimbabwe; Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe","title":"Nutritional factors associated with distribution of Mopani Worms in Mopani woodlands in Tsholotsho and Gwanda Districts, Zimbabwe: A comparative survey","id":"46c39620-debb-4d59-8584-1ced874cc047"}
{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between visual field (VF) loss, vision-related quality of life (QoL) and glaucoma-related symptoms in a large cohort of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. POAG patients with or without VF defects or “glaucoma suspect” patients were considered eligible. QoL was assessed using the validated versions of the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and glaucoma-related symptoms were assessed using the Glaucoma Symptom Scale (GSS). Patients were classified as having VF damage in one eye (VFD-1), both eyes (VFD-2), or neither eye (VFD-0). 3227 patients were enrolled and 2940 were eligible for the analysis. 13.4% of patients were classified in the VFD-0, 23.7% in the VFD-1, and 62.9% in the VFD-2 group. GSS visual symptoms domain (Func-4) and GSS non-visual symptoms domain (Symp-6) scores were similar for the VFD-0 and VFD-1 groups (p = 0.133 and p = 0.834 for Func-4 and Symp-6, respectively). VFD-0 group had higher scores than VFD-2 both in Func-4 (p \u003c 0.001) and Symp-6 domains (p = 0.035).

{"abstract":"Environmental pollution with plastic waste has gained increasing attention, as the contamination of aquatic habitats poses a challenge to these ecosystems. Plastic waste has direct negative effects on animals such as reduced growth rate, fecundity or life span. However, the indirect effects of plastic waste, which has the ability to sorb chemicals from the surrounding media, on chemical communication have yet to be investigated. Chemical communication is crucial for aquatic organisms, e.g., to avoid predation. The planktonic water flea Daphnia (Crustacea), an important link between trophic levels, relies on info-chemicals (kairomones) to assess its current predation risk and to form inducible defences. We show that plastic waste, composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) interferes with the formation of inducible defences in Daphnia longicephala when exposed to a combination of kairomones of Notonecta glauca and plastic waste. D. longicephala shows a reduction in all defensive traits, including body length, crest width and time until primiparity, compared to exposure to solely kairomone conditioned media. Plastic waste in the absence of kairomones had no effect on defensive traits. Since it is vital to adjust these defences to the current predation risk, any misperception can have far-reaching ecological consequences. Therefore, plastic waste can have indirect effects on organisms, which may manifest at the community level.","authors":"B. Trotter; A. F. R. M. Ramsperger; P. Raab; J. Haberstroh; C.

{"abstract":"Gene function in cancer is often cell type-specific. The epithelial cell-specific transcription factor ELF3 is a documented tumor suppressor in many epithelial tumors yet displays oncogenic properties in others. Here, we show that ELF3 is an oncogene in the adenocarcinoma subtype of lung cancer (LUAD), providing genetic, functional, and clinical evidence of subtype specificity. We discover a region of focal amplification at chromosome 1q32.1 encompassing the ELF3 locus in LUAD which is absent in the squamous subtype. Gene dosage and promoter hypomethylation affect the locus in up to 80% of LUAD analyzed. ELF3 expression was required for tumor growth and a pan-cancer expression network analysis supports its subtype and tissue specificity. We further show that ELF3 displays strong prognostic value in LUAD but not LUSC. We conclude that, contrary to many other tumors of epithelial origin, ELF3 is an oncogene and putative therapeutic target in LUAD. Tissue context can dictate why a gene can have seemingly opposing functions in different settings. ELF3 is tumor suppressive in many cancers of epithelial origin but in lung cancer, the authors describe an oncogenic role in the adenocarcinoma histology of non-small cell lung cancer.","authors":"Katey S.

These data represent key information in ecology and conservation, particularly for rare or endangered species. Presence absence (PA) and presence only (PO) records of European Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur in Germany were used to run SDMs, whilst climate and land coverage variables provided environmental information. GLM (Generalised Linear model), GBM (Generalised Boosted model), CTA (Classification Tree analysis), SRE (Surface Range Envelope) and RF (Random Forests) algorithms were run with both datasets. Best model quality was obtained with PO in the RF algorithm (AUC 0.83). PA and PO probability maps differed substantially, but both excluded mountainous regions as potential occurrence areas. However, PO probability maps were more discriminatory and highlighted a possible distribution of Turtle Doves near Saarbrucken, west of Dusseldorf, in the Black Forest lowlands and Lusatia. Mainly, the climate variables ‘minimum temperature in January’ and ‘precipitation of the warmest quarter’ shaped these results, but variables like soil type or agricultural management strategy could improve future SDMs to specify local habitat requirements and develop habitat management strategies. Eventually, the study demonstrated the utility of PO data in SDMs, particularly for scarce species.","authors":"Melanie Marx; Petra Quillfeldt","keywords":"Conservation biology; Ecological modelling","organization_affiliated":"Department of Animal Ecology \u0026 Systematics, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Giessen, Germany; Department of Animal Ecology \u0026 Systematics, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Giessen, Germany","title":"Species distribution models of European Turtle Doves in Germany are more reliable with presence only rather than presence absence data","id":"06180f85-2ebe-4f30-a94c-31579baef914"}
{"abstract":"We investigate theoretically the effect of periodic magnetic barriers on the transport for a Weyl semimetal. We find that there are momentum and spin filtering tunneling behaviors, which is controlled by the numbers of the magnetic barriers. For the tunneling through periodic square-shaped magnetic barriers, the transmission is angular φ asymmetry, and the asymmetrical transmission probability becomes more pronounced with increasing the superlattice number n. However, the transmission is symmetric with respect to angle γ, and the window of the transmission become more and more narrower with increasing the number of barriers, i.e., the collimator behavior. This feature comes from the electron Fabry-Pérot modes among the barriers. We find that the constructive interference of the backscattering amplitudes suppress transmissions, and consequently form the minigaps of the transmission. The transmission can be switched on/off by tuning the incident energies and angles, the heights and numbers of the magnetic barriers, and result in the interesting collimator behavior.","authors":"Xunwu Hu; Fang Cheng","keywords":"Spintronics; Topological insulators","organization_affiliated":"Department of Physics and Electronic Science, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China; Department of Physics and Electronic Science, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China","title":"Electron collimator in Weyl semimetals with periodic magnetic barriers","id":"686bf5a4-941c-4af7-bc79-4ed5cce7730b"}
{"abstract":"Recent findings from The Cancer Genome Atlas project have provided a comprehensive map of genomic alterations that occur in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including unexpected mutations in apolipoprotein B (APOB). We aimed to determine the clinical significance of this non-oncogenetic mutation in HCC. An Apob gene signature was derived from genes that differed between control mice and mice treated with siRNA specific for Apob (1.5-fold difference; P \u003c 0.005). Human gene expression data were collected from four independent HCC cohorts (n = 941). A prediction model was constructed using Bayesian compound covariate prediction, and the robustness of the APOB gene signature was validated in HCC cohorts. The correlation of the APOB signature with previously validated gene signatures was performed, and network analysis was conducted using ingenuity pathway analysis. APOB inactivation was associated with poor prognosis when the APOB gene signature was applied in all human HCC cohorts. Poor prognosis with APOB inactivation was consistently observed through cross-validation with previously reported gene signatures (NCIP A, HS, high-recurrence SNUR, and high RS subtypes). Knowledge-based gene network analysis using genes that differed between low-APOB and high-APOB groups in all four cohorts revealed that low-APOB activity was associated with upregulation of oncogenic and metastatic regulators, such as HGF, MTIF, ERBB2, FOXM1, and CD44, and inhibition of tumor suppressors, such as TP53 and PTEN. In conclusion, APOB inactivation is associated with poor outcome in patients with HCC, and APOB may play a role in regulating multiple genes involved in HCC development. Mutation of a gene with no clear role in tumor development triggers a cascade of reactions that can cause liver cancer. Recent genome-wide analyses searching for genes connected to development of hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, have turned up some unexpected genes, such as the fat metabolism gene apolipoprotein A (APOB). To discover how APOB is related to liver tumor development, Sun Young Yim at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA, and coworkers compared whole-genome profiles from human cancer patients with those of mice, in which cancer-related genetic patterns are better characterized. They found that mutation of APOB was associated with switching on of cancer-promoting genes, and switching off of genes that suppress tumor growth. These results reveal a behind-the-scenes regulator of cancer development.","authors":"Gena Lee; Yun Seong Jeong; Do Won Kim; Min Jun Kwak; Jiwon Koh; Eun Wook Joo; Ju-Seog Lee; Susie Kah; Yeong-Eun Sim; Sun Young Yim","keywords":"Cancer genomics; Liver cancer; Prognostic markers","organization_affiliated":"Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Gynecology, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea","title":"Clinical significance of APOB inactivation in hepatocellular carcinoma","id":"215ebb57-6d38-4982-9ba1-f37b4cff577b"}
{"abstract":"Cavity spectroscopy measurements elucidate the Fermi polaron nature of the optical excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The dynamics of a mobile quantum impurity in a degenerate Fermi system is a fundamental problem in many-body physics. The interest in this field has been renewed due to recent ground-breaking experiments with ultracold Fermi gases1,2,3,4,5. Optical creation of an exciton or a polariton in a two-dimensional electron system embedded in a microcavity constitutes a new frontier for this field due to an interplay between cavity coupling favouring ultralow-mass polariton formation6 and exciton–electron interactions leading to polaron or trion formation7,8. Here, we present cavity spectroscopy of gate-tunable monolayer MoSe2 (ref. 9) exhibiting strongly bound trion and polaron resonances, as well as non-perturbative coupling to a single microcavity mode10,11. As the electron density is increased, the oscillator strength determined from the polariton splitting is gradually transferred from the higher-energy repulsive exciton-polaron resonance to the lower-energy attractive exciton-polaron state. Simultaneous observation of polariton formation in both attractive and repulsive branches indicates a new regime of polaron physics where the polariton impurity mass can be much smaller than that of the electrons. Our findings shed new light on optical response of semiconductors in the presence of free carriers by identifying the Fermi polaron nature of excitonic resonances and constitute a first step in investigation of a new class of degenerate Bose–Fermi mixtures12,13.","authors":"Meinrad Sidler; Patrick Back; Ovidiu Cotlet; Ajit Srivastava; Thomas Fink; Martin Kroner; Eugene Demler; Atac Imamoglu","keywords":"Optical properties and devices; Two-dimensional materials","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland; Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland; Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland; Physics Department, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 22138, USA; Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland; Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland; Physics Department, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA; Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland","title":"Fermi polaron-polaritons in charge-tunable atomically thin semiconductors","id":"68711666-f6da-4f15-82e3-8c99ab903556"}
{"abstract":"Control of electron spin coherence via external fields is fundamental in spintronics. Its implementation demands a host material that accommodates the desirable but contrasting requirements of spin robustness against relaxation mechanisms and sizeable coupling between spin and orbital motion of the carriers. Here, we focus on Ge, which is a prominent candidate for shuttling spin quantum bits into the mainstream Si electronics. So far, however, the intrinsic spin-dependent phenomena of free electrons in conventional Ge/Si heterojunctions have proved to be elusive because of epitaxy constraints and an unfavourable band alignment. We overcome these fundamental limitations by investigating a two-dimensional electron gas in quantum wells of pure Ge grown on Si. These epitaxial systems demonstrate exceptionally long spin lifetimes. In particular, by fine-tuning quantum confinement we demonstrate that the electron Landé g factor can be engineered in our CMOS-compatible architecture over a range previously inaccessible for Si spintronics. Ge/Si heterojunctions are prominent candidates for spintronics, but the spin-dependent phenomena have been elusive.

{"abstract":"The complex effects of estradiol on non-reproductive tissues/cells, including lymphoid tissues and immunocytes, have increasingly been explored. However, the role of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the regulation of these genomic and non-genomic actions of estradiol is controversial. Moreover, the expression of SHBG and its internalization by potential receptors, as well as the influence of SHBG on estradiol uptake and signaling in lymphocytes has remained unexplored. Here, we found that human and mouse T cells expressed SHBG intrinsically. In addition, B lymphoid cell lines as well as both primary B and T lymphocytes bound and internalized external SHBG, and the amount of plasma membrane-bound SHBG decreased in B cells of pregnant compared to non-pregnant women. As potential mediators of this process, SHBG receptor candidates expressed by lymphocytes were identified in silico, including estrogen receptor (ER) alpha. Furthermore, cell surface-bound SHBG was detected in close proximity to membrane ERs while highly colocalizing with lipid rafts. The SHBG-membrane ER interaction was found functional since SHBG promoted estradiol uptake by lymphocytes and subsequently influenced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In conclusion, the SHBG-SHBG receptor-membrane ER complex participates in the rapid estradiol signaling in lymphocytes, and this pathway may be altered in B cells in pregnant women.","authors":"Andrea Balogh; Eva Karpati; Andrea E.

{"abstract":"The β-lactams are the most widely used group of antibiotics in human health and agriculture, but this is under threat due to the persistent rise of pathogenic resistance. Several compounds, including tunicamycin (TUN), can enhance the antibacterial activity of the β-lactams to the extent of overcoming resistance, but the mammalian toxicity of TUN has precluded its use in this role. Selective hydrogenation of TUN produces modified compounds (TunR1 and TunR2), which retain the enhancement of β-lactams while having much lower mammalian toxicity. Here we show that TunR1 and TunR2 enhance the antibacterial activity of multiple β-lactam family members, including penems, cephems, and third-generation penicillins, to a similar extent as does the native TUN. Eleven of the β-lactams tested were enhanced from 2 to \u003e256-fold against Bacillus subtilis, with comparable results against a penicillin G-resistant strain. The most significant enhancements were obtained with third-generation aminothiazolidyl cephems, including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefquinome. These results support the potential of low toxicity tunicamycin analogs (TunR1 and TunR2) as clinically valid, synergistic enhancers for a broad group of β-lactam antibiotics.","authors":"Neil P. J.

{"abstract":"While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce CARNIVAL, a causal network contextualization tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed protein–protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied CARNIVAL to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease. CARNIVAL identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators dysregulated in IgAN including Wnt and TGF-β, which we subsequently validated experimentally. These results demonstrated how CARNIVAL generates hypotheses on potential upstream alterations that propagate through signaling networks, providing insights into diseases. Changes in gene expression are generally indirect consequences of upstream dysregulation, and it is often important to understand what caused it. A team of researchers led by Julio Saez-Rodriguez from Heidelberg and Aachen has developed CARNIVAL to infer causal networks of proteins upstream of gene expression. In the first step, dysregulated transcription factors are inferred from gene expression. Subsequently, an algorithm finds explanations for their up- or down-regulation through known protein–protein interactions using an ILP formulation. Optionally, known targets of perturbation can be provided. This integration of different sources of prior knowledge led to higher performance than alternative methods and was able to identify key pathways and proteins, including TGFβ signaling and β-Catenin, in a case study on IgA nephropathy. Overall, CARNIVAL may provide clues to understand causal mechanisms in diseases and treatments.","authors":"Anika Liu; Panuwat Trairatphisan; Enio Gjerga; Athanasios Didangelos; Jonathan Barratt; Julio Saez-Rodriguez","keywords":"Regulatory networks; Software","organization_affiliated":"Heidelberg University, Faculty of Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Bioquant, Heidelberg, Germany; RWTH Aachen University, Faculty of Medicine, Joint Research Centre for Computational Biomedicine (JRC-COMBINE), Aachen, Germany; Heidelberg University, Faculty of Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Bioquant, Heidelberg, Germany; Heidelberg University, Faculty of Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Bioquant, Heidelberg, Germany; RWTH Aachen University, Faculty of Medicine, Joint Research Centre for Computational Biomedicine (JRC-COMBINE), Aachen, Germany; Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; Heidelberg University, Faculty of Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Bioquant, Heidelberg, Germany; RWTH Aachen University, Faculty of Medicine, Joint Research Centre for Computational Biomedicine (JRC-COMBINE), Aachen, Germany","title":"From expression footprints to causal pathways: contextualizing large signaling networks with CARNIVAL","id":"55f3523c-f531-4d4b-bc8c-70871e364d42"}
{"abstract":"Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) learn to produce songs in a manner reminiscent of spoken language development in humans. One candidate gene implicated in influencing learning is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype 2B glutamate receptor (NR2B). Consistent with this idea, NR2B levels are high in the song learning nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) during juvenile vocal learning, and decreases to low levels in adults after learning is complete and the song becomes more stereotyped. To test for the role of NR2B in generating song plasticity, we manipulated NR2B expression in LMAN of adult male zebra finches by increasing its protein levels to those found in juvenile birds, using a lentivirus containing the full-length coding sequence of the human NR2B subunit. We found that increased NR2B expression in adult LMAN induced increases in song sequence diversity and slower song tempo more similar to juvenile songs, but also increased syllable repetitions similar to stuttering. We did not observe these effects in control birds with overexpression of NR2B outside of LMAN or with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in LMAN. Our results suggest that low NR2B subunit expression in adult LMAN is important in conserving features of stereotyped adult courtship song.","authors":"Mukta Chakraborty; Liang-Fu Chen; Emma E.

{"abstract":"Recent years have seen a surge in the use of low-dimensional transition metal dichacolgenides, such as MoS2, as catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. In particular, sulfur vacancies in MoS2 can activate the inert basal plane, but that requires an unrealistically high defect concentration (~9%) to achieve optimal activity. In this work, we demonstrate by first-principles calculations that assembling van der Waals heterostructures can enhance the catalytic activity of MoS2 with low concentrations of sulfur vacancies. We integrate MoS2 with various two-dimensional nanostructures, including graphene, h-BN, phosphorene, transition metal dichacolgenides, MXenes, and their derivatives, aiming to fine-tune the free energy of atomic hydrogen adsorption. Remarkably, an optimal free energy can be achieved for a low sulfur vacancy concentration of ~2.5% in the MoS2/MXene-OH heterostructure, as well as high porosity and tunability. These results demonstrate the potential of combining two-dimensional van der Waals assembly with defect engineering for efficient hydrogen production.","authors":"Faling Ling; Wei Kang; Huirong Jing; Wen Zeng; Yankun Chen; Xiaoqing Liu; Yixin Zhang; Lin Qi; Liang Fang; Miao Zhou","keywords":"Electrocatalysis; Electronic structure; Surfaces, interfaces and thin films; Two-dimensional materials","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology and System of Ministry of Education, College of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, P.

{"abstract":"LiCuVO4 is a model system of a 1D spin-1/2 chain that enters a planar spin-spiral ground state below its Néel temperature of 2.4 K due to competing nearest and next nearest neighbor interactions. The spin-spiral state is multiferroic with an electric polarization along the a axis which has been proposed to be caused purely by the spin supercurrent mechanism. With external magnetic fields in c direction TN can be suppressed down to 0 K at 7.4 T. Here we report dynamical measurements of the polarization from P(E)-hysteresis loops, magnetic field dependent pyro-current and non-linear dielectric spectroscopy as well as thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements at very low temperatures. The multiferroic transition is accompanied by strong anomalies in the thermal expansion and magnetostriction coefficients and we find slow switching times of electric domain reversal. Both observations suggest a sizable magnetoelastic coupling in LiCuVO4. By analyzing the non-linear polarization dynamics we derive domain sizes in the nm range that are probably caused by Li defects.","authors":"Christoph P.

{"abstract":"Responsive hydrogels that undergo controlled shape changes in response to a range of stimuli are of interest for microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. However, these applications require fabrication methods capable of preparing complex, heterogeneous materials. Here we report a new approach for making patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels, on a micrometre to millimetre scale. Nanolitre aqueous pre-gel droplets were connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures. By using this droplet network technology to pattern domains containing temperature-responsive or non-responsive hydrogels, structures that undergo reversible curling were produced. Through patterning of gold nanoparticle-containing domains into the hydrogels, light-activated shape change was achieved, while domains bearing magnetic particles allowed movement of the structures in a magnetic field. To highlight our technique, we generated a multi-responsive hydrogel that, at one temperature, could be moved through a constriction under a magnetic field and, at a second temperature, could grip and transport a cargo. Responsive hydrogels are of interest for a range of potential applications, including microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. Now, a versatile fabrication approach has been developed to prepare patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels. Pre-gel droplets are connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures that respond to a variety of stimuli.","authors":"Florence G.

{"abstract":"The analysis of the brain from a connectivity perspective is revealing novel insights into brain structure and function. Discovery is, however, hindered by the lack of prior knowledge used to make hypotheses. Additionally, exploratory data analysis is made complex by the high dimensionality of data. Indeed, to assess the effect of pathological states on brain networks, neuroscientists are often required to evaluate experimental effects in case-control studies, with hundreds of thousands of connections. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the multivariate relationships in brain connections that characterize two distinct groups, hence permitting the investigators to immediately discover the subnetworks that contain information about the differences between experimental groups. In particular, we are interested in data discovery related to connectomics, where the connections that characterize differences between two groups of subjects are found. Nevertheless, those connections do not necessarily maximize the accuracy in classification since this does not guarantee reliable interpretation of specific differences between groups. In practice, our method exploits recent machine learning techniques employing sparsity to deal with weighted networks describing the whole-brain macro connectivity. We evaluated our technique on functional and structural connectomes from human and murine brain data. In our experiments, we automatically identified disease-relevant connections in datasets with supervised and unsupervised anatomy-driven parcellation approaches and by using high-dimensional datasets.","authors":"Alessandro Crimi; Luca Giancardo; Fabio Sambataro; Alessandro Gozzi; Vittorio Murino; Diego Sona","keywords":"Network models; Neurological disorders","organization_affiliated":"Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, USA; Department of Experimental and Clinical Medical Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy; Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rovereto, Italy; Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Department of Computer Science, University of Verona, Verona, Italy; Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Neuroinformatics Laboratory, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy","title":"MultiLink Analysis: Brain Network Comparison via Sparse Connectivity Analysis","id":"66efe547-1a81-405d-a94a-c60336f1fe83"}

With increasingly complex measurement procedures individual data points are often not just numbers or simple vectors in which all components are of the same kind. Analysis methods that capitalize on slopes in a single real-valued data track or that make explicit use of the vectorial nature of the data are not applicable in such scenaria. We develop here a framework for segmentation in arbitrary data domains that only requires a minimal notion of similarity. Using unsupervised clustering of (a sample of) the input yields an approximate segmentation algorithm that is efficient enough for genome-wide applications. As a showcase application we segment a time-series of transcriptome sequencing data from budding yeast, in high temporal resolution over ca. 2.5 cycles of the short-period respiratory oscillation. The algorithm is used with a similarity measure focussing on periodic expression profiles across the metabolic cycle rather than coverage per time point.","authors":"Rainer Machné; Douglas B.

{"abstract":"High-entropy materials have attracted considerable interest due to the combination of useful properties and promising applications. Predicting their formation remains the major hindrance to the discovery of new systems. Here we propose a descriptor—entropy forming ability—for addressing synthesizability from first principles. The formalism, based on the energy distribution spectrum of randomized calculations, captures the accessibility of equally-sampled states near the ground state and quantifies configurational disorder capable of stabilizing high-entropy homogeneous phases. The methodology is applied to disordered refractory 5-metal carbides—promising candidates for high-hardness applications. The descriptor correctly predicts the ease with which compositions can be experimentally synthesized as rock-salt high-entropy homogeneous phases, validating the ansatz, and in some cases, going beyond intuition. Several of these materials exhibit hardness up to 50% higher than rule of mixtures estimations. The entropy descriptor method has the potential to accelerate the search for high-entropy systems by rationally combining first principles with experimental synthesis and characterization. The overwhelming number of possible high-entropy materials represents a big challenge for predicting their existence. Here, the authors introduce an entropy-forming-ability descriptor capturing the synthesizability of these systems, and apply the model to the discovery of new refractory metal carbides.","authors":"Pranab Sarker; Tyler Harrington; Cormac Toher; Corey Oses; Mojtaba Samiee; Jon-Paul Maria; Donald W.

{"abstract":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) caused by PKD1 mutations is one of the most common hereditary disorders. However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments. Most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are due to mutations in PKD1. Here, Tsukiyama et al. generate monkeys with mutations in PKD1 and show that animals recapitulate key pathological features of the human disease, suggesting these may provide insights into ADPKD pathogenesis and contribute to the development of future therapeutic strategies.","authors":"Tomoyuki Tsukiyama; Kenichi Kobayashi; Masataka Nakaya; Chizuru Iwatani; Yasunari Seita; Hideaki Tsuchiya; Jun Matsushita; Kahoru Kitajima; Ikuo Kawamoto; Takahiro Nakagawa; Koji Fukuda; Teppei Iwakiri; Hiroyuki Izumi; Iori Itagaki; Shinji Kume; Hiroshi Maegawa; Ryuichi Nishinakamura; Saori Nishio; Shinichiro Nakamura; Akihiro Kawauchi; Masatsugu Ema","keywords":"Disease model; Genetic engineering; Mechanisms of disease","organization_affiliated":"Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology (WPI-ASHBi), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Urology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology (WPI-ASHBi), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd, Kagoshima, Japan; Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd, Kagoshima, Japan; Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; The Corporation for Production and Research of Laboratory Primates, Ibaraki, Japan; Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Kidney Development, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Division of Rheumatology, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Urology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan; Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology (WPI-ASHBi), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan","title":"Monkeys mutant for PKD1 recapitulate human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease","id":"3731ddae-98db-4e55-9c81-26d27d73536d"}

Bacteria such as Helicobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, and Bacillus were found to dominate within fruit bodies, indicating that they were crucial in the development of macro-fungi. The bacterial richness in the hyphosphere soils of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) was higher than that of SAF and significant difference in the composition of bacterial communities was observed. There were more Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroides in the hyphosphere soils of EcMF, and comparatively more Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi in the hyphosphere of SAF.

{"abstract":"The DNA damage checkpoint senses the presence of DNA lesions and controls the cellular response thereto. A crucial DNA damage signal is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is frequently found at sites of DNA damage and recruits the sensor checkpoint kinase Mec1-Ddc2. However, how this signal – and therefore the cell's DNA damage load – is quantified, is poorly understood. Here, we use genetic manipulation of DNA end resection to induce quantitatively different ssDNA signals at a site-specific double strand break in budding yeast and identify two distinct signalling circuits within the checkpoint. The local checkpoint signalling circuit leading to γH2A phosphorylation is unresponsive to increased amounts of ssDNA, while the global checkpoint signalling circuit, which triggers Rad53 activation, integrates the ssDNA signal quantitatively. The global checkpoint signal critically depends on the 9-1-1 and its downstream acting signalling axis, suggesting that ssDNA quantification depends on at least two sensor complexes. DNA damage triggers checkpoint signalling mechanisms. Here the authors reveal differential phosphorylation of targets of the Mec1-Ddc2 checkpoint kinase by analyzing the effect of quantitatively different ssDNA signals.","authors":"Susanne C. S.

{"abstract":"Depredation of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) nests is a leading cause of reduced recruitment for the recovering and iconic game species. Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are known to depredate nests, and have been expanding throughout the distributed range of wild turkeys in North America. We sought to gain better insight on the magnitude of wild pigs depredating wild turkey nests. We constructed simulated wild turkey nests throughout the home ranges of 20 GPS-collared wild pigs to evaluate nest depredation relative to three periods within the nesting season (i.e., early, peak, and late) and two nest densities (moderate = 12.5-25 nests/km2, high = 25-50 nests/km2) in south-central Texas, USA during March–June 2016. Overall, the estimated probability of nest depredation by wild pigs was 0.3, equivalent to native species of nest predators in the study area (e.g., gray fox [Urocyon cinereoargenteus], raccoon [Procyon lotor], and coyote [Canis latrans]). Female wild pigs exhibited a constant rate of depredation regardless of nesting period or density of nests. However, male wild pigs increased their rate of depredation in areas with higher nest densities. Management efforts should remove wild pigs to reduce nest failure in wild turkey populations especially where recruitment is low.","authors":"Heather N. Sanders; David G. Hewitt; Humberto L.

{"abstract":"Cosmic-ray muon radiography has been used to non-invasively visualize the voids in the Great Pyramid (Khufu’s Pyramid), revealing a large void situated above the Grand Gallery. The Great Pyramid of Giza holds many secrets. There is no consensus on how it was built and most of its internal structure, besides three chambers, is not known. Kunihiro Morishima and colleagues used cosmic-ray muons, which are weakly deflected and absorbed by stone, as a natural imaging probe to investigate the possibility of hidden chambers. They installed a muon detector—a nuclear emulsion film—in one of the chambers and collected data over several months. They observed a clear increase in the flux of muons for specific positions above the known chambers, which indicates the presence of a previously unknown void. The findings are supported by data from two other detection techniques. This is the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century. The Great Pyramid, or Khufu’s Pyramid, was built on the Giza plateau in Egypt during the fourth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops)1, who reigned from 2509 bc to 2483 bc. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there is no consensus about how it was built2,3. To understand its internal structure better, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic rays that are only partially absorbed by stone4,5,6. The resulting cosmic-ray muon radiography allows us to visualize the known and any unknown voids in the pyramid in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery of a large void (with a cross-section similar to that of the Grand Gallery and a minimum length of 30 metres) situated above the Grand Gallery. This constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the nineteenth century1. The void, named ScanPyramids’ Big Void, was first observed with nuclear emulsion films7,8,9 installed in the Queen’s chamber, then confirmed with scintillator hodoscopes10,11 set up in the same chamber and finally re-confirmed with gas detectors12 outside the pyramid. This large void has therefore been detected with high confidence by three different muon detection technologies and three independent analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough for the understanding of the internal structure of Khufu’s Pyramid. Although there is currently no information about the intended purpose of this void, these findings show how modern particle physics can shed new light on the world’s archaeological heritage.","authors":"Kunihiro Morishima; Mitsuaki Kuno; Akira Nishio; Nobuko Kitagawa; Yuta Manabe; Masaki Moto; Fumihiko Takasaki; Hirofumi Fujii; Kotaro Satoh; Hideyo Kodama; Kohei Hayashi; Shigeru Odaka; Sébastien Procureur; David Attié; Simon Bouteille; Denis Calvet; Christopher Filosa; Patrick Magnier; Irakli Mandjavidze; Marc Riallot; Benoit Marini; Pierre Gable; Yoshikatsu Date; Makiko Sugiura; Yasser Elshayeb; Tamer Elnady; Mustapha Ezzy; Emmanuel Guerriero; Vincent Steiger; Nicolas Serikoff; Jean-Baptiste Mouret; Bernard Charlès; Hany Helal; Mehdi Tayoubi","keywords":"Experimental particle physics; History","organization_affiliated":"F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; F-lab, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Ibaraki, Japan; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Institut de Recherche sur les lois Fondamentales de l’Univers (IRFU), Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), Université Paris Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; HIP Institute, Paris, France; Emissive, Paris, France; NHK Enterprises, Tokyo, Japan; Suave Images, Meguro-Ku, Japan; Cairo University, Oula, Egypt; Ain Shams University, Kasr el-Zaafaran, Abbasiya, Egypt; Cairo University, Oula, Egypt; Emissive, Paris, France; HIP Institute, Paris, France; HIP Institute, Paris, France; Inria, Villers-lès-Nancy, France; CNRS, Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France; Université de Lorraine, Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy, France; Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France; HIP Institute, Paris, France; Cairo University, Oula, Egypt; HIP Institute, Paris, France; Dassault Systèmes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France","title":"Discovery of a big void in Khufu’s Pyramid by observation of cosmic-ray muons","id":"9273e418-5ae9-4a16-b1d7-d60a17884b1e"}
{"abstract":"Empirical two-part models describe the relationship between conservation spending, human development pressures and biodiversity loss and can inform sustainable development strategies by predicting the effects of financing decisions on future biodiversity losses. Financial investments into conservation are often held back by a lack of certainty over the benefits of spending more. Anthony Waldron and colleagues assess the impact of conservation spending on biodiversity between 1996 and 2008 in 109 countries that signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity. They find that conservation spending over this period reduced national-level biodiversity loss by 29%, on average. They also find that the funding needed to achieve specific conservation goals rises with socioeconomic pressures. The authors develop a predictive model of biodiversity decline, which takes into account the effects of human development pressures and conservation financing. They propose that this could help to predict the funding that each country needs to achieve specific biodiversity policy goals, including those laid out in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the broader United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Halting global biodiversity loss is central to the Convention on Biological Diversity and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals1,2, but success to date has been very limited3,4,5. A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity6,7,8,9; however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment6,7,8,9. For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model10,11,12 that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a median average of 29% per country between 1996 and 2008 We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)13,14,15,16,17,18. Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds.","authors":"Anthony Waldron; Daniel C.

{"abstract":"Nudibranch molluscs occur in marine ecosystems worldwide and prey on numerous invertebrate species. During feeding, dietary fatty acids (FAs) unusual for nudibranchs are transferred to their lipids. Normal biomembrane functions require stable composition of structural polar lipids (PL), but the pathways of dietary FA utilization to PL in nudibranchs still remain unknown. A combination of chromatography and tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to determine total lipid, PL, FA, and PL molecular species composition of two cold-water species of Dendronotus, which then were compared with those of Tritonia tetraquetra. The use of FA trophic markers showed that Dendronotus sp. and T. tetraquetra prey on different soft corals, while D. robustus may consumes hydrocorals and bryozoans. Nudibranch FA profiles were strongly modified by dietary FAs but their PL profilers were similar. Dietary FAs are not included in ceramide aminoethylphosphonate and inositol glycerophospholipids, but directed to ethanolamine, choline, and serine glycerophospholipids and, in some cases, form isobaric molecular species with different FA chain lengths. For such isobaric species, nudibranchs reduce the length of alkyl groups when very-long-chain FAs are obtained with diet. This molecular mechanism may explain the adaptation of nudibranch membrane structure to dietary input of unusual FAs.","authors":"Andrey B. Imbs; Valeria P.

{"abstract":"This article addresses the phenomenological concept of the ‘world’, the ancient Greek notion of the ‘elementals’ as well as their empirically accessible derivatives (‘qualities’). These concepts are examined from the philosophical perspective, with David Foster Wallace’s essay Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley serving as an illustration. The purpose of the examination is to show how the world communicates itself through its basic structures and their qualities to a child who is engaged in play. The works of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and the Presocratics assist this study with a methodological framework. The provisional findings include the significance of the elementals (fire, water, earth, and air) for the perception of the world and its structures, as well as the role of ‘wind,’ which is presented as a quality of the elemental ‘air’ and, in a different interpretation, as a divinity. The collusion between a mortal and wind, with sky and earth forming the background for this relationship, produces unique circumstances for playing tennis in a place, which constantly challenges this activity. The notions of ‘childhood’ and ‘nostalgia’ are also touched upon, albeit in a cursive manner. This study is designed to show advantages of employing phenomenology and ancient Greek philosophy for the humanities in general and specifically for the analysis of contemporary literature.","authors":"Alexander Kozin","keywords":"Ethics; Philosophy","organization_affiliated":"University of Sussex, Brighton, UK","title":"On the elementals and their qualities in David Foster Wallace’s Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley","id":"084bc8f6-eccd-4f98-a25e-25671eff04a4"}
{"abstract":"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and other eating disorders continue to constitute significant challenges for individual and public health. AN is thought to develop as a result of complex interactions between environmental triggers, psychological risk factors, sociocultural influences, and genetic vulnerability. Recent research developments have highlighted a novel potentially relevant component in the AN etiology—activity of the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) gene that has emerged in several recent studies related to AN. HDAC4 is a member of the ubiquitously important family of epigenetic modifier enzymes called histone deacetylases and has been implicated in processes related to the formation and function of the central nervous system (CNS), bone, muscle, and metabolism. In a family affected by eating disorders, a missense mutation in HDAC4 (A786T) was found to segregate with the illness. The relevance of this mutation in eating-related behaviors was further confirmed with mouse models. Despite  the fact that HDAC4 has not been identified as a significant signal in genome-wide association studies in AN, several studies have found significant or near-significant methylation differences in HDAC4 locus in peripheral tissues of actively ill AN patients in comparison with different control groups. Limitations of these studies include a lack of understanding of to what extent the changes in methylation are predictive of AN as such changes might also occur as a consequence of the disease. It remains to be determined how methylation in peripheral tissues correlates with that in the CNS and how different methylation patterns affect HDAC4 expression. The present review discusses the findings and potential roles of HDAC4 in AN. Its emerging roles in learning and neuroplasticity may be specific and relevant for the etiology of AN and potentially lead to novel therapeutic approaches.","authors":"Mari Sild; Linda Booij","keywords":"Neuroscience; Psychiatric disorders","organization_affiliated":"Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada; CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Canada; Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada; CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada","title":"Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4): a new player in anorexia nervosa?","id":"e32126d7-72c6-4778-add7-c98aab162248"}

Stochastic processes theory and maximum likelihood were used to calculate the growth rate of new infections. Time-series analysis was then performed to assess correlations between the time series of new infections and new laboratory-confirmed cases. The rate of new infections showed significant seasonal fluctuation. Laboratory confirmation was delayed by a period of time longer than that of the infection (average delay, 13 days; standard deviation, 6.8 days). At the lags of −7.5 and −15 days, respectively, the time-series of new infections and new confirmed cases were significantly correlated; the cross correlation coefficients (CCFs) were 0.61 and 0.16, respectively.

{"abstract":"Previous studies have defined a state of metabolic reprogramming in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) T cells. Here Weyand and colleagues show that the rewiring of cellular metabolism renders RA T cells tissue invasive, directly promoting disease-inducing effector functions. Pathogenic T cells in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) infiltrate non-lymphoid tissue sites, maneuver through extracellular matrix and form lasting inflammatory microstructures. Here we found that RA T cells abundantly express the podosome scaffolding protein TKS5, which enables them to form tissue-invasive membrane structures. TKS5 overexpression was regulated by the intracellular metabolic environment of RA T cells—specifically, by reduced glycolytic flux that led to deficiencies in ATP and pyruvate. ATPlopyruvatelo conditions triggered fatty acid biosynthesis and the formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Restoration of pyruvate production or inhibition of fatty acid synthesis corrected the tissue-invasiveness of RA T cells in vivo and reversed their proarthritogenic behavior. Thus, metabolic control of T cell locomotion provides new opportunities to interfere with T cell invasion into specific tissue sites.","authors":"Yi Shen; Zhenke Wen; Yinyin Li; Eric L Matteson; Jison Hong; Jörg J Goronzy; Cornelia M Weyand","keywords":"Cellular immunity; Inflammation","organization_affiliated":"Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Division of Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, USA; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA","title":"Metabolic control of the scaffold protein TKS5 in tissue-invasive, proinflammatory T cells","id":"151203f7-28e0-469e-bd51-f81a019a7477"}
{"abstract":"We hypothesized a pro-inflammatory diet would be associated with higher prostate cancer (PC) risk. We prospectively recruited incident PC cases (n = 254) and controls (n = 328) at the Durham Veteran Affairs, from 2007 to 2018. From a self-completed 61-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, we calculated dietary inflammatory index (DII®) scores with and without supplements. We examined the association between DII scores with and without supplements and overall PC risk using logistic regression and risk of low-grade PC (grade group 1) and high-grade PC (grade group 2–5) with multinomial logistic regression. Cases were more likely to be Black (58 vs. 42%), had higher PSA (6.4 vs. 0.8 ng/ml), lower BMI (29.1 vs. 30.6 kg/m2) and were older (64 vs. 62 years) versus controls (all p \u003c 0.01). Both black controls and cases had higher DII scores with and without supplements, though the DII scores with supplements in controls was not significant. On multivariable analysis, there were no associations between DII with or without supplements and overall PC risk (p-trend = 0.14, p-trend = 0.09, respectively) or low-grade PC (p-trend = 0.72, p-trend = 0.47, respectively). Higher DII scores with (p-trend = 0.04) and without supplements (p = 0.08) were associated with high-grade PC, though the association for DII without supplements was not significant. A pro-inflammatory diet was more common among Black men and associated with high-grade PC in our case–control study. The degree to which a pro-inflammatory diet contributes to PC race disparities warrants further study. If confirmed, studies should test whether a low-inflammatory diet can prevent high-grade PC, particularly among Black men.","authors":"Adriana C. Vidal; Taofik Oyekunle; Lauren E.

{"abstract":"Current opinion views androgens as the pathogenic driver in the miniaturization of hair follicles of androgenetic alopecia by interfering with the dermal papilla. This cannot be the sole cause and therefore it is important for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes to identify additional pathways. Comparative full transcriptome profile analysis of the hair bulb region of normal and miniaturized hair follicles from vertex and occipital region in males with and without androgenetic alopecia revealed that next to the androgen receptor as well the retinoid receptor and particularly the PPAR pathway is involved in progressive hair miniaturization. We demonstrate the concurrent up-regulation of PPARGC1a in the epithelial compartment and androgen receptor in the dermal papilla of miniaturized hair. Dynamic Ppargc1a expression in the mouse hair cycle suggests a possible role in regulating hair growth and differentiation. This is supported by reduced proliferation of human dermal papilla and predominantly epithelial keratinocytes after incubation with AICAR, the agonist for AMPK signaling which activates PPARGC1a and serves as co-activator of PPARγ. In addition, miRNA profiling shows enrichment of miRNA-targeted genes in retinoid receptors and PPARGC1α/PPARγ signaling, and antigen presentation pathways.","authors":"Bryan Siu-Yin Ho; Candida Vaz; Srinivas Ramasamy; Elaine Guo Yan Chew; Jameelah Sheik Mohamed; Huma Jaffar; Axel Hillmer; Vivek Tanavde; Mei Bigliardi-Qi; Paul Lorenz Bigliardi","keywords":"DNA; Gene expression","organization_affiliated":"Experimental Dermatology Group, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Experimental Dermatology Group, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Experimental Dermatology Group, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; National University of Singapore, YLL School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore; Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Köln, Germany; Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Division of Biological \u0026 Life Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Ahmedabad, India; Experimental Dermatology Group, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Department of Dermatology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA; Experimental Dermatology Group, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore; Department of Dermatology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA","title":"Progressive expression of PPARGC1α is associated with hair miniaturization in androgenetic alopecia","id":"d034ce21-8f6d-4f2f-b9e8-b3e7a1bf7626"}
{"abstract":"Severe infection with the re-emerging enterovirus 71 (EV71 or EV-A71) can cause cardiopulmonary failure. However, in patients’ heart and lung, viral protein has not been detected. In mouse models, heart disease has not been reported. EV71-infected brainstem is generally believed to be responsible for the cardiopulmonary collapse. One major limitation in EV71 research is the lack of an efficient oral infection system using non-mouse-adapted clinical isolates. In a robust oral infection NOD/SCID mouse model, we detected EV71 protein at multiple organs, including heart and lung, in 100% of moribund mice with limb paralysis. Infiltrating leukocytes were always detected in heart and muscle, and VP1-positive M2 macrophages were abundant in the lung. Functional dissection on the pathogenesis mechanism revealed severe apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, and abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) in orally infected hearts. Therefore, cardiopulmonary disease could be one plausible cause of death in this mouse model. Inoculation of EV71 through an oral route resulted in viral infection in the intestine, viremia, and EV71 appeared to spread to peripheral tissues via blood circulation. Infectious virus was no longer detected in the blood on day 5 post-infection by the plaque formation assay. We demonstrated that both EV71 clinical isolate and cloned virus can target the cardiopulmonary system via a natural infection-like oral route.","authors":"Chih-Shin Chang; Chun-Che Liao; An-Ting Liou; Ya-Shu Chang; Ya-Ting Chang; Bing-Hsiean Tzeng; Chien-Chang Chen; Chiaho Shih","keywords":"Infection; Viral pathogenesis","organization_affiliated":"Program in Molecular Medicine, National Yang-Ming University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan International Graduate Program in Molecular Medicine, National Yang-Ming University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Cardiovascular Section, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital and Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Enterovirus 71 targets the cardiopulmonary system in a robust oral infection mouse model","id":"08ef0839-19b7-499a-acc3-660b8e784b9f"}
{"abstract":"Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) is among the most challenging complications of spinal cord injury (SCI). A recent report by us demonstrated an improvement in NDO in SCI rats following chronic systemic treatment with the purine nucleoside inosine. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of inosine underlying improvement of NDO. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent complete spinal cord transection at T8. Inosine (1 mM) delivered intravesically to SCI rats during conscious cystometry significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous non-voiding contractions. In isolated tissue assays, inosine (1 mM) significantly decreased the amplitude of spontaneous activity (SA) in SCI bladder muscle strips. This effect was prevented by a pan-adenosine receptor antagonist CGS15943, but not by A1 or A3 receptor antagonists. The A2A antagonist ZM241385 and A2B antagonist PSB603 prevented the effect of inosine. The effect of inosine was mimicked by the adenosine receptor agonist NECA and the A2B receptor agonist BAY60-6583. The inhibition of SA by inosine was not observed in the presence of the BK antagonist, iberiotoxin, but persisted in the presence of KATP and SK antagonists. These findings demonstrate that inosine acts via an A2B receptor-mediated pathway that impinges on specific potassium channel effectors.","authors":"Claire Doyle; Vivian Cristofaro; Bryan S.

This investigation focus on the association of zerumbone in HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation and its link with TNF-alpha. The study shows that with the increasing concentration of zerumbone, there was a reduction of HCT116 cells proliferation based on the cell line study and hence higher TNF-alpha inhibition based on the TNF-alpha assay. The study also emphasizes on the computational aspect by investigating the molecular docking analysis of zerumbone against TNF-alpha. The docked complex was further validated using molecular dynamics simulation studies. The docking analysis observed that alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl scaffold is an important moiety for the anti-cancer activity of zerumbone. Furthermore, the DFT analysis also confirms the reactivity nature of zerumbone based on the frontier molecular orbital analysis.","authors":"Salam Pradeep Singh; Khumukcham Nongalleima; Ningthoujam Indrajit Singh; Pradip Doley; Chingakham Brajakisor Singh; Thiyam Ramsing Singh; Dinabandhu Sahoo","keywords":"Colon cancer; Virtual drug screening","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India; Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India; Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India; Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India; Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India; Department of Biotechnology, Manipur University, Canchipur, India; Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Takyelpat, Imphal, India","title":"Zerumbone reduces proliferation of HCT116 colon cancer cells by inhibition of TNF-alpha","id":"0eb871ce-3614-49b8-9893-e19387cb73a4"}
{"abstract":"Wave control is usually performed by spatially engineering the properties of a medium. Because time and space play similar roles in wave propagation, manipulating time boundaries provides a complementary approach. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the relevance of this concept by introducing instantaneous time mirrors. We show with water waves that a sudden change of the effective gravity generates time-reversed waves that refocus at the source. We generalize this concept for all kinds of waves, introducing a universal framework which explains the effect of any time disruption on wave propagation. We show that sudden changes of the medium properties generate instant wave sources that emerge instantaneously from the entire space at the time disruption. The time-reversed waves originate from these ‘Cauchy sources’, which are the counterpart of Huygens virtual sources on a time boundary. It allows us to revisit the holographic method and introduce a new approach for wave control. Using a water bath subject to a sudden vertical jolt — representing a change in the effective gravity — researchers demonstrate the concept of a ‘time mirror’, where time-reversed waves return to their point source following a downward jolt.","authors":"Vincent Bacot; Matthieu Labousse; Antonin Eddi; Mathias Fink; Emmanuel Fort","keywords":"Fluid dynamics; Optical physics; Physics","organization_affiliated":"Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS, PSL Research University, 1 rue Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France; Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS, PSL Research University, 1 rue Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France; Matière et Systèmes Complexes, Université Paris Diderot, CNRS 7057, Sorbonne Paris Cité, 10 Rue A.

{"abstract":"Intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic events is a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder, characterized by rich and vivid sensory details as reported in “flashbacks”. While prevailing models of trauma intrusions focus on dysregulated emotional processes, we hypothesize that a deficiency in intrinsic sensory inhibition could drive overactivation of sensory representations of trauma memories, precipitating sensory-rich intrusions. In a sample of combat veterans, we examined resting-state alpha (8–12 Hz) oscillatory activity (in both power and posterior→frontal connectivity), given its role in sensory cortical inhibition, in association with intrusive re-experiencing symptoms. Veterans further participated in an odor task (including both combat and non-combat odors) to assess olfactory trauma memory and emotional response. We observed an association between intrusive re-experiencing symptoms and attenuated resting-state posterior→frontal alpha connectivity, which were both correlated with olfactory trauma memory. Importantly, olfactory trauma memory was identified as a mediator of the relationship between alpha connectivity and intrusive re-experiencing, suggesting that deficits in intrinsic sensory inhibition contributed to intrusive re-experiencing of trauma via heightened trauma memory. Therefore, by permitting unfiltered sensory cues to enter information processing and activate sensory representations of trauma, sensory disinhibition can constitute a sensory mechanism of intrusive re-experiencing in trauma-exposed individuals.","authors":"Kevin J.

{"abstract":"Intracellular replication of the deadly pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis relies on the production of small organic molecules called siderophores that scavenge iron from host proteins1. M. tuberculosis produces two classes of siderophore, lipid-bound mycobactin and water-soluble carboxymycobactin2,3. Functional studies have revealed that iron-loaded carboxymycobactin is imported into the cytoplasm by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter IrtAB4, which features an additional cytoplasmic siderophore interaction domain5. However, the predicted ABC exporter fold of IrtAB is seemingly contradictory to its import function. Here we show that membrane-reconstituted IrtAB is sufficient to import mycobactins, which are then reduced by the siderophore interaction domain to facilitate iron release. Structure determination by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy not only confirms that IrtAB has an ABC exporter fold, but also reveals structural peculiarities at the transmembrane region of IrtAB that result in a partially collapsed inward-facing substrate-binding cavity. The siderophore interaction domain is positioned in close proximity to the inner membrane leaflet, enabling the reduction of membrane-inserted mycobactin. Enzymatic ATPase activity and in vivo growth assays show that IrtAB has a preference for mycobactin over carboxymycobactin as its substrate. Our study provides insights into an unusual ABC exporter that evolved as highly specialized siderophore-import machinery in mycobacteria. The mycobacterial ABC transporter IrtAB functions as a siderophore importer despite exhibiting an exporter fold in its structure, and contains a siderophore interaction domain capable of siderophore reduction and iron release inside the cell.","authors":"Fabian M.

{"abstract":"Renewed dietary recommendations for carbohydrates have recently been published by various international health authorities. The present work (1) reviews the methods and processes (systematic approach/review, inclusion of public consultation) used to identify, select and grade the evidence underpinning the recommendations, particularly for total carbohydrate (CHO), fibre and sugar consumption, and (2) examines the extent to which variation in the methods and processes applied relates to any differences in the final recommendations. A search of WHO, US, Canada, Australia and European sources identified 19 documents from 13 authorities with the desired detailed information. Processes and methods applied to derive recommendations were compiled and compared. (1) A relatively high total CHO and fibre intake and limited intake of (added or free) sugars are generally recommended. (2) Even where recommendations are similar, the specific justifications for quantitative/qualitative recommendations differ across authorities. (3) Differences in recommendations mainly arise from differences in the underlying definitions of CHO exposure and classifications, the degree to which specific CHO-providing foods and food components were considered, and the choice and number of health outcomes selected. (4) Differences in the selection of source material, time frames or data aggregation and grading methods appeared to have minor influence. Despite general consistency, apparent differences among the recommendations of different authorities would likely be minimized by: (1) More explicit quantitative justifications for numerical recommendations and communication of uncertainty, and (2) greater international harmonization, particularly in the underlying definitions of exposures and range of relevant nutrition-related outcomes.","authors":"A.

{"abstract":"Apoptosis and autophagy are harmoniously regulated biological processes for maintaining tissue homeostasis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a metabolic sensor to coordinate cellular survival and function in various organs, including the kidney. We investigated the renoprotective effects of cinacalcet in high-glucose treated human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs), murine podocytes and C57BLKS/J-db/db mice. In cultured HGECs and podocytes, cinacalcet decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis and increased autophagy that were attributed to the increment of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinaseβ (CaMKKβ)-Liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMPK and their downstream signals including the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increases in superoxide dismutases and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2/BCL-2-associated X protein expression. Interestingly, intracellular chelator BAPTA-AM reversed cinacalcet-induced CaMKKβ elevation and LKB1 phosphorylation. Cinacalcet reduced albuminuria without influencing either blood glucose or Ca2+ concentration and ameliorated diabetes-induced renal damage, which were related to the increased expression of calcium-sensing receptor and the phosphorylation of CaMKKβ-LKB1. Subsequent activation of AMPK was followed by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α and phospho-Ser1177eNOS-nitric oxide, resulting in a decrease in apoptosis and oxidative stress as well as an increase in autophagy. Our results suggest that cinacalcet increases intracellular Ca2+ followed by an activation of CaMKKβ-LKB1-AMPK signaling in GECs and podocytes in the kidney, which provides a novel therapeutic means for type 2 diabetic nephropathy by modulation of apoptosis and autophagy.","authors":"Ji Hee Lim; Hyung Wook Kim; Min Young Kim; Tae Woo Kim; Eun Nim Kim; Yaeni Kim; Sungjin Chung; Young Soo Kim; Bum Soon Choi; Yong-Soo Kim; Yoon Sik Chang; Hye Won Kim; Cheol Whee Park","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vincent’s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Suwon, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea","title":"Cinacalcet-mediated activation of the CaMKKβ-LKB1-AMPK pathway attenuates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice by modulation of apoptosis and autophagy","id":"0f77e3ca-1781-46b9-a1d4-6d1bd9b7340d"}
{"abstract":"Nowadays, early oral feeding after gastrectomy has been gradually accepted and applied in the clinical practice, but there is still no specific uniform feeding regimen available which works best for patients in different regions with different races and eating habits. Aiming to establish an early oral feeding schedule suitable for local Chinese patients after gastric surgery, from May 2014 to May 2018, 87 gastric cancer patients undergoing various types of gastric resections were enrolled in an early feeding protocol and their clinical course was reviewed retrospectively. A stepwise, local patient-specific, early oral feeding schedule was proposed, implemented within an early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol and accessed in terms of its safety and tolerability. The primary surgical outcomes included: a median (interquartile range; IQR) postoperative hospital stay of 6 (3) days; 67 (77%) patients were well tolerant of this schedule from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 4; 20 (23%) patients had mild I/II grade complications (Clavien-Dindo classification); 3 (3%) patients had IIIB complications, zero cases of hospital mortality. Compared to similar studies in the past, our early oral feeding program is also safe and beneficial, and it can shorten the postoperative hospital stay without causing any increase in postoperative complications. In summary, our work herein reported the establishment of a detailed early oral feeding schedule embedded within an ERAS protocol which was found to be suitable for local Chinese patients after gastric surgery. Accordingly, this early oral feeding schedule is worth further research and promotion.","authors":"Ji Chen; Ming Xu; Yunpeng Zhang; Chun Gao; Peng Sun","keywords":"Gastric cancer; Nutrition; Surgical oncology","organization_affiliated":"Department of General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China","title":"Effects of a stepwise, local patient-specific early oral feeding schedule after gastric cancer surgery: a single-center retrospective study from China","id":"f790b8af-4066-4d22-969a-d9218bfe49ce"}
{"abstract":"Jos Jonkers, Lodewyk Wessels and colleagues use a Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis screen to identify genes required for invasive lobular breast carcinoma formation (ILC) in mice. They find recurrent and mutually exclusive insertions in Myh9, Ppp1r12a, Ppp1r12b and Trp53bp2, which are implicated in the actin cytoskeleton regulation pathway and have been found to be altered in human ILC breast cancer. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common breast cancer subtype and accounts for 8–14% of all cases. Although the majority of human ILCs are characterized by the functional loss of E-cadherin (encoded by CDH1), inactivation of Cdh1 does not predispose mice to develop mammary tumors, implying that mutations in additional genes are required for ILC formation in mice. To identify these genes, we performed an insertional mutagenesis screen using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system in mice with mammary-specific inactivation of Cdh1. These mice developed multiple independent mammary tumors of which the majority resembled human ILC in terms of morphology and gene expression. Recurrent and mutually exclusive transposon insertions were identified in Myh9, Ppp1r12a, Ppp1r12b and Trp53bp2, whose products have been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Notably, MYH9, PPP1R12B and TP53BP2 were also frequently aberrated in human ILC, highlighting these genes as drivers of a novel oncogenic pathway underlying ILC development.","authors":"Sjors M Kas; Julian R de Ruiter; Koen Schipper; Stefano Annunziato; Eva Schut; Sjoerd Klarenbeek; Anne Paulien Drenth; Eline van der Burg; Christiaan Klijn; Jelle J ten Hoeve; David J Adams; Marco J Koudijs; Jelle Wesseling; Micha Nethe; Lodewyk F A Wessels; Jos Jonkers","keywords":"Breast cancer; Mutagenesis; Transcriptomics","organization_affiliated":"Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Experimental Animal Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Cancer Genomics Netherlands, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Cancer Genomics Netherlands, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","title":"Insertional mutagenesis identifies drivers of a novel oncogenic pathway in invasive lobular breast carcinoma","id":"311c1465-8e6e-43dd-8535-a9d413fc3e9c"}

{"abstract":"Syntrophic interspecies electron exchange is essential for the stable functioning of diverse anaerobic microbial communities. Hydrogen/formate interspecies electron transfer (HFIT), in which H2 and/or formate function as diffusible electron carriers, has been considered to be the primary mechanism for electron transfer because most common syntrophs were thought to lack biochemical components, such as electrically conductive pili (e-pili), necessary for direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). Here we report that Syntrophus aciditrophicus, one of the most intensively studied microbial models for HFIT, produces e-pili and can grow via DIET. Heterologous expression of the putative S. aciditrophicus type IV pilin gene in Geobacter sulfurreducens yielded conductive pili of the same diameter (4 nm) and conductance of the native S. aciditrophicus pili and enabled long-range electron transport in G. sulfurreducens. S. aciditrophicus lacked abundant c-type cytochromes often associated with DIET. Pilin genes likely to yield e-pili were found in other genera of hydrogen/formate-producing syntrophs. The finding that DIET is a likely option for diverse syntrophs that are abundant in many anaerobic environments necessitates a reexamination of the paradigm that HFIT is the predominant mechanism for syntrophic electron exchange within anaerobic microbial communities of biogeochemical and practical significance.","authors":"David J.

{"abstract":"Graphene nanoribbons are ideal candidates to serve as highly conductive, flexible, and transparent interconnections, or the active channels for nanoelectronics. However, patterning narrow graphene nanoribbons to \u003c100 nm wide usually requires inefficient micro/nano fabrication processes, which are hard to implement for large area or flexible electronic and sensory applications. Here, we develop a precise and scalable nanowire lithography technology that enables reliable batch manufacturing of ultra-long graphene nanoribbon arrays with programmable geometry and narrow width down to ~50 nm. The orderly graphene nanoribbons are patterned out of few-layer graphene sheets by using ultra-long silicon nanowires as masks, which are produced via in-plane solid–liquid–solid guided growth and then transferred reliably onto various stiff or flexible substrates. More importantly, the geometry of the graphene nanoribbons can be predesigned and engineered into elastic two-dimensional springs to achieve outstanding stretchability of \u003e30%, while carrying stable and repeatable electronic transport. We suggest that this convenient scalable nanowire lithography technology has great potential to establish a general and efficient strategy to batch-pattern or integrate various two-dimensional materials as active channels and interconnections for emerging flexible electronic applications.","authors":"Chuan Liu; Bing Yao; Taige Dong; Haiguang Ma; Shaobo Zhang; Junzhuan Wang; Jun Xu; Yi Shi; Kunji Chen; Libo Gao; Linwei Yu","keywords":"Nanoscale devices; Nanowires","organization_affiliated":"National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; School of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China; School of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures/School of Electronics Science and Engineering, Nanjing, China","title":"Highly stretchable graphene nanoribbon springs by programmable nanowire lithography","id":"06335de7-cc3f-471d-a93c-f401d69bf6ea"}
{"abstract":"Older adult patients with hip fractures are 3–4 times more likely to die within one-year after surgery than general population. The study aimed to identify independent predictive factors associated with one-year mortality after hip fracture surgery. A prospective prognostic cohort study was performed. All patients aged ≥65 years, consecutively admitted in three Italian hospitals with a diagnosis of fragility hip fracture were included. Patients with periprosthetic or pathological fractures were excluded. Multivariate analysis was used to determine variables that significantly increased the risk of one-year mortality and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess their predictive capacity on the outcome.1083 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and the one-year follow-up was reached in 728 patients. The 16.6% of patients died within one-year after surgery.

{"abstract":"Interactions between microtubule (MT) interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains and their binding proteins are important for the accurate progression of many cellular processes that require the AAA+ ATPase machinery. Therefore, knowledge on the structural basis of MIT domain interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AAA+ ATPase function. Katanin is a MT-severing AAA+ ATPase that consists of p60 and p80 subunits. Although, the hexameric p60 subunit is active alone, its association with the p80 subunit greatly enhances both the MT-binding and -severing activities of katanin. However, the molecular mechanism of how the p80 subunit contributes to katanin function is currently unknown. Here, we structurally and functionally characterized the interaction between the two katanin subunits that is mediated by the p60-MIT domain and the p80 C-terminal domain (p80-CTD). We show that p60-MIT and p80-CTD form a tight heterodimeric complex, whose high-resolution structure we determined by X-ray crystallography. Based on the crystal structure, we identified two conserved charged residues that are important for p60-MIT:p80-CTD complex formation and katanin function. Moreover, p60-MIT was compared with other MIT domain structures and similarities are discussed.","authors":"Lenka Rezabkova; Kai Jiang; Guido Capitani; Andrea E. Prota; Anna Akhmanova; Michel O.

{"abstract":"The genetics underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex. Approximately 3–5% of ASD cases arise from maternally inherited duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1, termed Duplication 15q syndrome (Dup15q). 15q11.2-q13.1 includes the gene UBE3A which is believed to underlie ASD observed in Dup15q syndrome. UBE3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation and trafficking, so finding UBE3A substrates and interacting partners is critical to understanding Dup15q ASD. In this study, we take an unbiased genetics approach to identify genes that genetically interact with Dube3a, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of UBE3A. We conducted an enhancer/suppressor screen using a rough eye phenotype produced by Dube3a overexpression with GMR-GAL4. Using the DrosDel deficiency kit, we identified 3 out of 346 deficiency lines that enhanced rough eyes when crossed to two separate Dube3a overexpression lines, and subsequently identified IA2, GABA-B-R3, and lola as single genes responsible for rough eye enhancement. Using the FlyLight GAL4 lines to express uas-Dube3a + uas-GFP in the endogenous lola pattern, we observed an increase in the GFP signal compared to uas-GFP alone, suggesting a transcriptional co-activation effect of Dube3a on the lola promoter region. These findings extend the role of Dube3a/UBE3A as a transcriptional co-activator, and reveal new Dube3a interacting genes.","authors":"Kevin A. Hope; Addison McGinn; Lawrence T.

{"abstract":"The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex plays an important role in gene expression regulation, stem cell self-renewal, and lineage commitment. However, little is known about the dynamics of NuRD during cellular differentiation. Here, we study these dynamics using genome-wide profiling and quantitative interaction proteomics in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We find that the genomic targets of NuRD are highly dynamic during differentiation, with most binding occurring at cell-type specific promoters and enhancers. We identify ZFP296 as an ESC-specific NuRD interactor that also interacts with the SIN3A complex. ChIP-sequencing in Zfp296 knockout (KO) ESCs reveals decreased NuRD binding both genome-wide and at ZFP296 binding sites, although this has little effect on the transcriptome. Nevertheless, Zfp296 KO ESCs exhibit delayed induction of lineage-specific markers upon differentiation to embryoid bodies. In summary, we identify an ESC-specific NuRD-interacting protein which regulates genome-wide NuRD binding and cellular differentiation. The NuRD complex plays an important role in regulating lineage commitment and cell fate during early embryonic development.

{"abstract":"The invisibility cloak, a long-standing fantastic dream for humans, has become more tangible with the development of metamaterials. Recently, metasurface-based invisibility cloaks have been proposed and realized with significantly reduced thickness and complexity of the cloaking shell. However, the previous scheme is based on reflection-type metasurfaces and is thus limited to reflection geometry. In this work, by integrating the wavefront tailoring functionality of transparent metasurfaces and the wave tunneling functionality of zero-index materials, we have realized a unique type of hybrid invisibility cloak that functions in transmission geometry. The principle is general and applicable to arbitrary shapes. For experimental demonstration, we constructed a rhombic double-layer cloaking shell composed of a highly transparent metasurface and a double-zero medium consisting of dielectric photonic crystals with Dirac cone dispersions. The cloaking effect is verified by both full-wave simulations and microwave experimental results. The principle also reveals exciting possibilities for realizing skin-thick ultrathin cloaking shells in transmission geometry, which can eliminate the need for spatially varying extreme parameters. Our work paves a path for novel optical and electromagnetic devices based on the integration of metasurfaces and metamaterials. Chinese scientists have developed an innovative technique for making an invisibility cloak that could pave the way for new optical and electromagnetic devices. Although invisibility cloaks by bending light around an object have been around for some time, they are bulky and complex devices with spatially gradient parameters, limiting their uses. Now, Yun Lai and his colleagues from Nanjing University and Soochow University, in collaboration with researchers from Fudan University, have developed a new technique that combines the properties of metamaterials and metasurfaces to produce an invisibility cloak that is significantly thinner and less complex than currently available. The hybrid device integrates the wavefront tailoring functionality of transparent metasurfaces with the wave tunneling functionality of materials with near-zero-refractive index, and enables a new approach of cloaking by creating the illusion of free space.","authors":"Hongchen Chu; Qi Li; Bingbing Liu; Jie Luo; Shulin Sun; Zhi Hong Hang; Lei Zhou; Yun Lai","keywords":"Metamaterials; Sub-wavelength optics","organization_affiliated":"School of Physical Science and Technology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics and Key Laboratory of Micro and Nano Photonic Structures (Ministry of Education), Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing, China; School of Physical Science and Technology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; School of Physical Science and Technology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Ultra-Precision Optical Manufacturing, Green Photonics and Department of Optical Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, China; School of Physical Science and Technology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics and Key Laboratory of Micro and Nano Photonic Structures (Ministry of Education), Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing, China; School of Physical Science and Technology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing, China; National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","title":"A hybrid invisibility cloak based on integration of transparent metasurfaces and zero-index materials","id":"1eb48fc2-2d56-4089-bfea-83e32fcfbbd9"}
{"abstract":"Mucosal healing plays a critical role in combatting the effects of inflammatory bowel disease, fistulae and ulcers. While most treatments for such diseases focus on systemically delivered anti-inflammatory drugs, often leading to detrimental side effects, mucosal healing agents that target the gut epithelium are underexplored. We genetically engineer Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create fibrous matrices that promote gut epithelial integrity in situ. These matrices consist of curli nanofibers displaying trefoil factors (TFFs), known to promote intestinal barrier function and epithelial restitution. We confirm that engineered EcN can secrete the curli-fused TFFs in vitro and in vivo, and is non-pathogenic. We observe enhanced protective effects of engineered EcN against dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice, associated with mucosal healing and immunomodulation. This work lays a foundation for the development of a platform in which the in situ production of therapeutic protein matrices from beneficial bacteria can be exploited. Anti-inflammatory treatments for gastrointestinal diseases can often have detrimental side effects. Here the authors engineer E. coli Nissle 1917 to create a fibrous matrix that has a protective effect in DSS-induced colitis mice.","authors":"Pichet Praveschotinunt; Anna M.

{"abstract":"Population structure and biogeography of marine organisms are formed by different drivers than in terrestrial organisms. Yet, very little information is available even for common marine organisms and even less for their associated parasites. Here we report the first analysis of population structure of both a cephalopod host (Sepia officinalis) and its dicyemid parasite, based on a homologous molecular marker (cytochrome oxidase I). We show that the population of common cuttlefish in the Mediterranean area is fragmented into subpopulations, with some areas featuring restricted level of gene flow. Amongst the studied areas, Sardinia was genetically the most diverse and Cyprus the most isolated. At a larger scale, across the Mediterranean, the population structure of the parasite shows co-diversification pattern with its host, but a slower rate of diversification. Differences between the two counterparts are more obvious at a finer scale, where parasite populations show increased level of fragmentation and lower local diversities. This discrepancy can be caused by local extinctions and replacements taking place more frequently in the dicyemid populations, due to their parasitic lifestyle.","authors":"Marie Drábková; Nikola Jachníková; Tomáš Tyml; Hana Sehadová; Oleg Ditrich; Eva Myšková; Václav Hypša; Jan Štefka","keywords":"Biogeography; Coevolution; Evolutionary biology","organization_affiliated":"Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Biology Centre, CAS, v.v.i., České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Biology Centre, CAS, v.v.i., České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic; Biology Centre, CAS, v.v.i., České Budějovice, Czech Republic","title":"Population co-divergence in common cuttlefish ( Sepia officinalis ) and its dicyemid parasite in the Mediterranean Sea","id":"4b76fdd4-6a95-4df6-9776-2dae98196772"}
{"abstract":"In Trichomonas vaginalis, the TvCyP1-catalyzed conformational switches of two glycinyl-prolyl imide bonds in Myb3 were previously shown to regulate the trafficking of Myb3 from cytoplasmic membrane compartments towards the nucleus. In this study, TvCyP2 was identified as a second cyclophilin that binds to Myb3 at the same dipeptide motifs. The enzymatic proficiency of TvCyP2, but not its binding to Myb3, was aborted by a mutation of Arg75 in the catalytic domain. TvCyP2 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum with a weak signal that extensively extends into the cytoplasm as well as to the plasma membrane according to an immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, TvCyP2 was co-enriched with TvCyP1 and Myb3 in various membrane fractions purified by differential and gradient centrifugation. TvCyP2 was found to proficiently enzymatically regulate the distribution of TvCyP1 and Myb3 among purified membrane fractions, and to localize TvCyP1 in hydrogenosomes and on plasma membranes. Protein complexes immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells overexpressing TvCyP1 and TvCyP2 were found to share some common components, like TvCyP1, TvCyP2, TvBip, Myb3, TvHSP72, and the hydrogenosomal heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Direct interaction between TvCyP1 and TvCyP2 was confirmed by a GST pull-down assay. Fusion of vesicles with hydrogenosomes was observed by transmission electron microscopy, whereas TvCyP1, TvCyP2, and Myb3 were each detected at the fusion junction by immunoelectron microscopy. These observations suggest that T. vaginalis may have evolved a novel protein trafficking pathway to deliver proteins among the endomembrane compartments, hydrogenosomes and plasma membranes.","authors":"Hong-Ming Hsu; Yu-Hsin Huang; Sarita Aryal; Hsing-Wei Liu; Chinpan Chen; Shu-Hui Chen; Chien-Hsin Chu; Jung-Hsiang Tai","keywords":"Endoplasmic reticulum; Protein translocation","organization_affiliated":"Department of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Structural Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Structural Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Chemistry, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Endomembrane Protein Trafficking Regulated by a Tv CyP2 Cyclophilin in the Protozoan Parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis","id":"57febf4c-142c-44f6-be59-9c1ba8e897e3"}
{"abstract":"Human germ cell tumours (GCTs) are derived from stem cells of the early embryo and the germ line. They occur in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and also in extragonadal sites, where migrating primordial germ cells are located during embryogenesis. This group of heterogeneous neoplasms is unique in that their developmental potential is in effect determined by the latent potency state of their cells of origin, which are reprogrammed to omnipotent, totipotent or pluripotent stem cells. Seven GCT types, defined according to their developmental potential, have been identified, each with distinct epidemiological and (epi)genomic features. Heritable predisposition factors affecting the cells of origin and their niches likely explain bilateral, multiple and familial occurrences of the different types of GCTs. Unlike most other tumour types, GCTs are rarely caused by somatic driver mutations, but arise through failure to control the latent developmental potential of their cells of origin, resulting in their reprogramming. Consistent with their non-mutational origin, even the malignant tumours of the group are characterized by wild-type TP53 and high sensitivity for DNA damage. However, tumour progression and the rare occurrence of treatment resistance are driven by embryonic epigenetic state, specific (sub)chromosomal imbalances and somatic mutations. Thus, recent progress in understanding GCT biology supports a comprehensive developmental pathogenetic model for the origin of all GCTs, and provides new biomarkers, as well as potential targets for treatment of resistant disease. Human germ cell tumours are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that occur in the gonads and extragonadal sites along the midline of the body. This Review outlines a developmental pathogenetic model for the origin of all germ cell tumours, which is based on the unscheduled reprogramming of cells of the early embryo and germ line.","authors":"J.

{"abstract":"The paper aims to investigate the cytotoxic effect on tumor cells of irradiated AuNPs in green light and subsequently functionalized with HS-PEG-NH2. The toxicity level of gold conjugates after their functionalization with DOX and TAT peptide was also evaluated. The AuNPs were prepared using the modified Turkevich method and exposed to visible light at a wavelength of 520 nm prior their PEGylation. The optical properties were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy, the surface modification was investigated using FTIR and XPS spectroscopies and their sizes and morphologies were evaluated by TEM and DLS techniques. DOX and TAT peptide were linked to the surface of PEGylated AuNPs by reacting their amino groups with glycidyloxypropyl of PEGylated DOX or TAT conjugates under mild conditions at room temperature and in the presence of ethanol as catalyst. The conjugates containing DOX or DOX and TAT have been characterized by fluorescence and FTIR techniques. The changes of electrochemical features were observed using cyclic voltammetry, suggesting a better stability of irradiated nanoparticles. By mass spectrometry it was confirmed that the compounds of interest were obtained. The cell viability test showed that irradiated and non-irradiated nanoparticles coated with PEG are not toxic in normal cells. Tumor cell viability analysis showed that the PEGylated nanoparticles modified with DOX and TAT peptide were more effective than pristine DOX, indicating cytotoxicity up to 10% higher than non-irradiated ones.","authors":"Raoul V.

{"abstract":"Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are important in the cardiovascular disease susceptibility and drug response. The methylation of cytosine in the promoter of genes could influence expression. The interindividual differences of drug response could only be explained partly by the polymorphisms of drug disposition genes. This study was aimed to investigate the genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and eNOS in Chinese Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, and Han volunteers. Blood samples were collected from 842 unrelated Chinese healthy subjects (323 Tibetan, 134 Mongolian, 162 Uygur, and 223 Han) for genotyping and part of the DNA samples were subjected to cytosine methylation analysis. Significant genetic and epigenetic interethnic polymorphisms of eNOS and CYP2D6 were found in the four Chinese groups. The 4b-G-T wild-type haplotype of eNOS was the most common in Chinese Tibetan (87.1%), Mongolian (79.9%), Uygur (76.4%), and Han (79.5%), respectively. eNOS T-786C creates a new CpG site and a significantly higher methylation level was found in −786CC than that in −786TC in Chinese Han (P = 0.0485) and total Chinese (P = 0.0104). CYP2D6 A-678 (rs28633410) makes the symmetrical CpG site changed to be an asymmetrical CpA site, and the methylation level of cytosine in the CpG context of G-678A was significantly higher than that in the CpA.

{"abstract":"Porcine protegrin-1 (PG-1) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with potent antimicrobial activities. We produced recombinant PG-1 and evaluated its cytotoxicity toward various types of mammalian cell lines, including embryonic fibroblasts, retinal cells, embryonic kidney cells, neuroblastoma cells, alveolar macrophage cells, and neutrophils. The sensitivity of the different mammalian cells to cytotoxic damage induced by PG-1 differed significantly among the cell types, with retinal neuron cells and neutrophils being the most significantly affected. A circular dichroism analysis showed there was a precise correlation between conformational changes in PG-1 and the magnitude of cytotoxicity among the various cell type. Subsequently, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) penetration assay using positively charged GFPs indicated there was a close correlation between the degree of penetration of charged GFP into cells and the magnitude of PG-1 cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we also showed that inhibition of the synthesis of anionic sulphated proteoglycans on the cell surface decreases the cytotoxic damage induced by PG-1 treatment. Taken together, the observed cytotoxicity of PG-1 towards different membrane surfaces is highly driven by the membrane’s anionic properties. Our results reveal a possible mechanism underlying cell-type dependent differences in cytotoxicity of AMPs, such as PG-1, toward mammalian cells.","authors":"Nagasundarapandian Soundrarajan; Suhyun Park; Quy Le Van Chanh; Hye-sun Cho; Govindan Raghunathan; Byeongyong Ahn; Hyuk Song; Jin-Hoi Kim; Chankyu Park","keywords":"Antimicrobial responses; Biological fluorescence","organization_affiliated":"Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Chemistry, University of Konstanz, Universitӓtsstraße 10, Konstanz, Germany; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea","title":"Protegrin-1 cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells positively correlates with the magnitude of conformational changes of the unfolded form upon cell interaction","id":"46b37046-59b1-4875-adf3-9590773a73c9"}
{"abstract":"Ischemic exercise conducted as low-load blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFRE) can lead to muscle remodelling and promote muscle growth, possibly through activation of muscle precursor cells. Cell activation can be triggered by blood borne extracellular vesicles (EVs) as these nano-sized particles are involved in long distance signalling. In this study, EVs isolated from plasma of healthy human subjects performing a single bout of BFRE were investigated for their change in EV surface profiles and miRNA cargos as well as their impact on skeletal muscle precursor cell proliferation. We found that after BFRE, five EV surface markers and 12 miRNAs were significantly altered. Furthermore, target prediction and functional enrichment analysis of the miRNAs revealed several target genes that are associated to biological pathways involved in skeletal muscle protein turnover. Interestingly, EVs from BFRE plasma increased the proliferation of muscle precursor cells. In addition, alterations in surface markers and miRNAs indicated that the combination of exercise and ischemic conditioning during BFRE can stimulate blood cells to release EVs. These results support that BFRE promotes EV release to engage in muscle remodelling and/or growth processes.","authors":"Jesper Just; Yan Yan; Jean Farup; Peter Sieljacks; Mette Sloth; Morten Venø; Tingting Gu; Frank Vincenzo de Paoli; Jens Randel Nyengaard; Rikke Bæk; Malene Møller Jørgensen; Jørgen Kjems; Kristian Vissing; Kim Ryun Drasbek","keywords":"Molecular medicine; Physiology","organization_affiliated":"Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Research laboratory for Biochemical Pathology, Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Dept of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Section for Sport Science, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Dept of Biomedicine – physiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Dept of Clinical Medicine, Core Center for Molecular Morphology, Section for Stereology and Microscopy, Centre for Stochastic Geometry and Advanced Bioimaging, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Dept of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark; Dept of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark; Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark; Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Dept of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Section for Sport Science, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Dept of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark","title":"Blood flow-restricted resistance exercise alters the surface profile, miRNA cargo and functional impact of circulating extracellular vesicles","id":"57b7ad50-ec7d-4edb-93f8-8c373ea3d8c1"}
{"abstract":"mRNAs transmit the genetic information that dictates protein production and are a nexus for numerous pathways that regulate gene expression. The prevailing view of canonical mRNA decay is that it is mediated by deadenylation and decapping followed by exonucleolysis from the 3′ and 5′ ends. By developing Akron-seq, a novel approach that captures the native 3′ and 5′ ends of capped and polyadenylated RNAs, respectively, we show that canonical human mRNAs are subject to repeated cotranslational and ribosome-phased endonucleolytic cuts at the exit site of the mRNA ribosome channel, in a process that we term ribothrypsis. We uncovered RNA G quadruplexes among likely ribothrypsis triggers and show that ribothrypsis is a conserved process. Strikingly, we found that mRNA fragments are abundant in living cells and thus have important implications for the interpretation of experiments, such as RNA-seq, that rely on the assumption that mRNAs exist largely as full-length molecules in vivo. Using Akron-seq, a novel approach that captures native 3′ and 5′ ends of capped and polyadenylated RNAs, Mourelatos and colleagues show that mRNAs are subject to repeated cotranslational endonucleolytic cuts at the ribosome exit channel.","authors":"Fadia Ibrahim; Manolis Maragkakis; Panagiotis Alexiou; Zissimos Mourelatos","keywords":"Ribosome; RNA decay","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Neuropathology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Penn Medicine Translational Neuroscience Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Neuropathology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Penn Medicine Translational Neuroscience Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Neuropathology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Penn Medicine Translational Neuroscience Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Neuropathology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Penn Medicine Translational Neuroscience Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA","title":"Ribothrypsis, a novel process of canonical mRNA decay, mediates ribosome-phased mRNA endonucleolysis","id":"2997b0fa-989f-4fc7-8532-09bba18035b9"}
{"abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation. Data of 195 patients were retrospectively analysed. Post-reperfusion aspartate (AST), alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were the primary measures of IRI. Tumour recurrence was the primary endpoint. Post-reperfusion AST was a continuous risk factor for tumour recurrence in patients within Milan criteria (p = 0.035), with an optimal cut-off of 1896 U/L. Recurrence-free survival of patients within Milan criteria and post-reperfusion AST of \u003c1896 and ≥1896 U/L was 96.6% and 71.9% at 5 and 3.7 years, respectively (p = 0.006). Additionally, post-reperfusion AST and LDH exceeding the upper quartile significantly increased the risk of HCC recurrence in patients within Milan criteria (p = 0.039, hazard ratio [HR] = 5.99 and p = 0.040, HR = 6.08, respectively) and to a lesser extent, in patients within Up-to-7 criteria (p = 0.028, HR = 3.58 and p = 0.039, HR = 3.33, respectively). No other significant IRI effects were found in patients beyond the Up-to-7 criteria and in analyses stratified for independent risk factors for recurrence: tumour number and differentiation, alpha-fetoprotein, and microvascular invasion. Thus, IRI exerts major negative effects on the risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation in patients within standard and extended criteria.","authors":"Michał Grąt; Marek Krawczyk; Karolina M.

{"abstract":"Protein phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification that can regulate the protein function. The current knowledge on the phosphorylation status of plant oil body (OB) proteins is inadequate. This present study identifies the distinct physiological substrates of Arabidopsis serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase (STYK) and its role in seed oil accumulation; the role of Arabidopsis OLE1, a major seed OB protein has also been elucidated. In vitro kinase assay followed by mass spectrometry identifies residue that are phosphorylated by STYK. Further, co-expression of OLE1 and STYK in yeast cells increases the cellular lipid levels and reduces the total lipid when OLE1 was replaced with OLE1T166A. Moreover, in vivo experiments with OB isolated from wild-type and styk knock-out lines show the ability of STYK to phosphorylate distinct OB proteins. OLE1T166A mutant and Arabidopsis styk mutant demonstrate the significant reduction of its substrate phosphorylation. styk mutant line significantly reduces the amount of total seed oil as compared to wild-type seeds. Together, our results provide the evidences that Arabidopsis At2G24360 (STYK) is phosphorylating oil body proteins and the phosphorylation regulates the oil content in Arabidopsis seeds.","authors":"Iyappan Ramachandiran; Anitha Vijayakumar; Visvanathan Ramya; Ram Rajasekharan","keywords":"Kinases; Oils","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; Lipidomics Center, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, India; Lipidomics Center, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, India; Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; Lipidomics Center, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, India","title":"Arabidopsis serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase phosphorylates oil body proteins that regulate oil content in the seeds","id":"ae3bae1a-4de8-459b-a539-12d7e0683a55"}

{"abstract":"Renal impairment is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM), accounting for 20–30% of MM patients at diagnosis and 40–50% of patients during the course of their disease. This feature is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival as compared to patients with normal renal function (NRF). Therefore, therapeutic management is challenging as autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is often not considered as a valuable strategy, mainly due to concerns of toxicity. In this retrospective and multicenter study, we included 55 MM patients with dialysis-dependent or independent renal failure who underwent high-dose melphalan-based ASCT in order to assess the efficacy outcomes and toxicities of this strategy. Response to ASCT was at least VGPR (very good PR) in 58% of patients and 96% of patients who also received bortezomib-based induction were at least in PR after ASCT. Median OS was 76 months and median PFS was 55 months, similarly to MM patients with NRF. In multivariate analysis, dose of melphalan (140 mg/m2) was correlated with better PFS (18 months, P = 0.005). Toxicities included febrile neutropenia (75%) and severe mucositis (34%). Overall, this work confirmed that ASCT conditioned by 140 mg/m2 melphalan is a beneficial procedure for MM patients with renal failure.","authors":"Karine Augeul-Meunier; Marie-Lorraine Chretien; Anne-Marie Stoppa; Lionel Karlin; Lofti Benboubker; Jose Miguel Torregrosa Diaz; Mohamad Mohty; Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha; Jacques-Olivier Bay; Aurore Perrot; Claude-Eric Bulabois; Anne Huynh; Mélanie Mercier; Laurent Frenzel; Hervé Avet-Loiseau; Régis Peffault de Latour; Jérôme Cornillon","keywords":"Myeloma; Therapeutics","organization_affiliated":"Institut de Cancérologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Dijon, Dijon, France; Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France; Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Bretonneau, Tours, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire La Miletrie, Poitiers, France; Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France; CHU de Lille, LIRIC INSERM U995, Université Lille 2, Lille, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, Nancy, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Grenoble, Grenoble, France; Institut Universitaire du Cancer, Toulouse, France; Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Angers, Angers, France; Hôpital Necker, Paris, France; Institut Universitaire du Cancer, Toulouse, France; Hôpital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Institut de Cancérologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France","title":"Extending autologous transplantation as first line therapy in multiple myeloma patients with severe renal impairment: a retrospective study by the SFGM-TC","id":"139633d6-60d6-4d7a-a012-a4d4cc5cb77f"}
{"abstract":"The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts variation in behaviour and physiology among individuals to be associated with variation in life history. Thus, individuals on the “fast” end of POLS continuum grow faster, exhibit higher metabolism, are more risk prone, but die earlier than ones on the “slow” end. Empirical support is nevertheless mixed and modelling studies suggested POLS to vary along selection gradients. Therefore, including ecological variation when testing POLS is vastly needed to determine whether POLS is a fixed construct or the result of specific selection processes. Here, we tested POLS predictions between and within two fish populations originating from different ecological conditions. We observed opposing life histories between populations, characterized by differential investments into growth, fecundity, and functional morphology under identical laboratory conditions. A slower life history was, on average, associated with boldness (latency to emergence from a refuge), high activity (short freezing time and long distance travelled), and increased standard metabolism. Correlation structures among POLS traits were not consistent between populations, with the expression of POLS observed in the slow-growing but not in the fast-growing population. Our results suggest that POLS traits can evolve independently from one another and that their coevolution depends upon specific ecological processes.","authors":"Giovanni Polverino; Francesca Santostefano; Carlos Díaz-Gil; Thomas Mehner","keywords":"Animal behaviour; Animal physiology; Behavioural ecology; Evolutionary ecology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biology and Ecology of Fishes, Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB), Berlin, Germany; Centre for Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia; Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, Canada; Department of Ecology and Marine Resources, Instituto Mediterráneo de Estudios Avanzados IMEDEA (CSIC-UIB), Esporles, Spain; Laboratori d’Investigacions Marines i Aqüicultura (LIMIA), Balearic Government, Port d’Andratx, Spain; Department of Biology and Ecology of Fishes, Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB), Berlin, Germany","title":"Ecological conditions drive pace-of-life syndromes by shaping relationships between life history, physiology and behaviour in two populations of Eastern mosquitofish","id":"6ddd35ef-457e-4792-8f51-50a1eb067d48"}
{"abstract":"Recent evidence suggests nonconstant nature of dispersion in adult women’s body mass index (BMI) across sociodemographic groups. The overall variances in BMI and height are also shown to have substantially changed over time. We modeled complex variation in adults’ anthropometry—BMI and height—by wealth and education, and assessed their differences over time in India. Data from a total of 768,130 women and 180,691 men from the Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2006 and 2016 were used for the analysis. The average association between wealth and education with anthropometry was assessed from linear regression models assuming constant variance. Individual heterogeneity was modeled to obtain separate variances in anthropometry for each wealth quintile and education level. All analyses were stratified by survey year and sex. On average, the positive socioeconomic gradient in adult’s BMI and height persisted over time with slight attenuation. The residual variance in BMI ranged from 10.1 to 14.9 (7.2–11.3) by education level and 6.1 to 17.4 (5.0–13.0) by household wealth for women (men) in 2006, and they increased over time for the lower socioeconomic groups but remained the same or decreased for the higher socioeconomic groups. No significant pattern was observed for variation in height for both genders. We found potential reversal in the socioeconomic patterning in BMI variability in India as suggested by the increasing dispersion among the least educated and poorest populations. For a comprehensive understanding of nutrition transition in developing countries, it is necessary to assess the changes in means and variances of anthropometry in tandem.","authors":"Rockli Kim; Praveen Kumar Pathak; Niharika Tripathi; S.

{"abstract":"The adoption of a new technology into basic research, and industrial and clinical settings requires rigorous testing to build confidence in the reproducibility, reliability, robustness, and relevance of these models. Tissue chips are promising new technology, they have the potential to serve as a valuable tool in biomedical research, as well as pharmaceutical development with regards to testing for efficacy and safety. The principal goals of this study were to validate a previously established proximal tubule tissue chip model in an independent laboratory and to extend its utility to testing of nephrotoxic compounds. Here, we evaluated critical endpoints from the tissue chip developer laboratory, focusing on biological relevance (long-term viability, baseline protein and gene expression, ammoniagenesis, and vitamin D metabolism), and toxicity biomarkers. Tissue chip experiments were conducted in parallel with traditional 2D culture conditions using two different renal proximal tubule epithelial cell sources. The results of these studies were then compared to the findings reported by the tissue chip developers. While the overall transferability of this advanced tissue chip platform was a success, the reproducibility with the original report was greatly dependent on the cell source. This study demonstrates critical importance of developing microphysiological platforms using renewable cell sources.","authors":"Courtney Sakolish; Elijah J. Weber; Edward J.

{"abstract":"α-Form zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), a kinetically favorable form of ZnPc, is an efficient photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy, especially when it is formed into nanowires (NWs), which have high water dispersibility. To take full advantage of this material, it is necessary to selectively grow kinetically favorable α-form ZnPc NWs over thermodynamically favorable β-form ZnPc NWs. The present study reports the selective growth of kinetically favorable α-form ZnPc NW crystals by a physical vapor transport method with flow rate control of the carrier gas. The flow rate is key for the dominant growth of α-form ZnPc NWs, thus enabling control of the crystal size, which critically affects the stability of ZnPc crystals. The yield of α-form ZnPc NWs was over 98% at a flow rate of 2000 sccm of Ar carrier gas. This approach could be applied for various Pc molecules, including copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). Our findings might contribute to the development of novel strategies for the selective growth of high-quality kinetically favorable crystals with a specific structure and provide great opportunities for their various practical applications. A technique for growing nanomaterials useful for treating cancer has been developed by researchers in South Korea. Nanowires have nanoscale diameters but much greater lengths and are useful in a wide range of applications. Zinc phthalocyanine nanowires, for example, can be injected into a tumor and heated using light to destroy the cancerous cells. These wires come in two forms: the α-form is more effective for this photodynamic therapy but many methods for synthesising zinc phthalocyanine nanowires tend to produce the less favourable -form. Hee Cheul Choi and colleagues from the Pohang University of Science and Technology have developed a method for creating α-form zinc phthalocyanine nanowires. The key to their success is to carefully control the flow rate of a gas carrying zinc phthalocyanine and copper phthalocyanine molecules across a silicon substate. Selective Growth of α-form Zinc Phthalocyanine Nanowires for High Water Dispersibility: Metastable α-form zinc phthalocyanine nanowires can be dominantly obtained by increasing the flow rate of carrier gas during physical vapor transport process, which leads to increased water dispersibility and opens the possibility of zinc phthalocyanine nanowires for practical cancer thrapy applications.

{"abstract":"During everyday interactions people constantly receive feedback on their behavior, which shapes their beliefs about themselves. While classic studies in the field of social learning suggest that people have a tendency to learn better from good news (positivity bias) when they perceive little opportunities to immediately improve their own performance, we show updating is biased towards negative information when participants perceive the opportunity to adapt their performance during learning. In three consecutive experiments we applied a computational modeling approach on the subjects’ learning behavior and reveal the negativity bias was specific for learning about own compared to others’ performances and was modulated by prior beliefs about the self, i.e. stronger negativity bias in individuals lower in self-esteem. Social anxiety affected self-related negativity biases only when individuals were exposed to a judging audience thereby potentially explaining the persistence of negative self-images in socially anxious individuals which commonly surfaces in social settings. Self-related belief formation is therefore surprisingly negatively biased in situations suggesting opportunities to improve and this bias is shaped by trait differences in self-esteem and social anxiety.","authors":"Laura Müller-Pinzler; Nora Czekalla; Annalina V.

{"abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently considered an important component of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The spectrum of NAFLD includes conditions that range from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. NAFLD is correlated with liver-related death and is predicted to be the most frequent indication for liver transplantation by 2030. Insulin resistance is directly correlated to the central mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients, which is strongly correlated to the imbalance of the renin–angiotensin system, that is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Among the emerging treatment approaches for NAFLD is the anti-hypertensive agent telmisartan, which has positive effects on liver, lipid, and glucose metabolism, especially through its action on the renin–angiotensin system, by blocking the ACE/AngII/AT1 axis and increasing ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas axis activation. However, treatment with this drug is only recommended for patients with an established indication for anti-hypertensive therapy. Thus, there is an increased need for large randomized controlled trials with the aim of elucidating the effects of telmisartan on liver disease, especially NAFLD. From this perspective, the present review aims to provide a brief examination of the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and the role of telmisartan on preventing liver disorders and thus to improve the discussion on potential therapies.","authors":"Luciana M.

{"abstract":"Covalently linked π-stacked dimers represent the most significant platform for elucidating the relationship between molecular alignments and their properties. Here, we present the one-pot synthesis of two intramolecularly π-stacked dimers and disclose how intramolecular stacking modes dictate photoswitching properties. The dimer, which features cofacially stacked chromophores and geometrically favours intramolecular photochemical [2 + 2] cycloadditions, displays a nearly irreversible photoswitching behaviour. By contrast, the dimer, bearing crosswise stacked chromophores, is geometrically unfavourable for the cycloaddition and exhibits a highly reversible photoswitching process, in which the homolysis and reformation of carbon−carbon single bonds are involved. Moreover, the chiral carbon centres of both dimers endow these photoswitches with chirality and the separated enantiomers exhibit tuneable chiroptical properties by photoswitching. This work reveals that intramolecular stacking modes significantly influence the photochemical properties of π-stacked dimers and offers a design strategy toward chiral photoswitchable materials. Covalently bridged π-stacked dimers are excellent molecular platforms for understanding the relationship between stacking orientation and properties. Here, the authors synthesize a pair of π-stacked dimers that are aligned either cofacially or crosswise, allowing them to compare how the intramolecular stacking mode affects each dimer’s photoswitching properties.","authors":"Ru-Qiang Lu; Xiao-Yun Yan; Lei Zhu; Lin-Lin Yang; Hang Qu; Xin-Chang Wang; Ming Luo; Yu Wang; Rui Chen; Xiao-Ye Wang; Yu Lan; Jian Pei; Wengui Weng; Haiping Xia; Xiao-Yu Cao","keywords":"Optical materials; Organic chemistry; Photochemistry","organization_affiliated":"State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Polymer Science, College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, USA; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China; Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), the Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","title":"Unveiling how intramolecular stacking modes of covalently linked dimers dictate photoswitching properties","id":"b08470ea-b93e-473a-af02-bd1b35173488"}
{"abstract":"The first successful theory of superconductivity was the one proposed by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957. This breakthrough fostered a remarkable growth of the field that propitiated progress and questionings, generating alternative theories to explain specific phenomena. For example, it has been argued that Bismuth, being a semimetal with a low number of carriers, does not comply with the basic hypotheses underlying BCS and therefore a different approach should be considered. Nevertheless, in 2016 based on BCS we put forth a prediction that Bi at ambient pressure becomes a superconductor at 1.3 mK. A year later an experimental group corroborated that in fact Bi is a superconductor with a transition temperature of 0.53 mK, a result that eluded previous work. So, since Bi is superconductive in almost all the different structures and phases, the question is why Bi-IV has been elusive and has not been found yet to superconduct? Here we present a study of the electronic and vibrational properties of Bi-IV and infer its possible superconductivity using a BCS approach. We predict that if the Bi-IV phase structure were cooled down to liquid helium temperatures it would also superconduct at a T c of 4.25 K.","authors":"Ariel A.

{"abstract":"Human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis. Approximately 15–25 million people are chronically infected with HDV. As a satellite virus of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), HDV uses the HBV-encoded envelope proteins for egress from and de novo entry into hepatocytes. So far, in vitro production of HDV particles is restricted to co-transfection of cells with HDV/HBV encoding cDNAs. This approach has several limitations. In this study, we established HuH7-END cells, which continuously secrete infectious HDV virions. The cell line was generated through stepwise stable integration of the cDNA of the HDV antigenome, the genes for the HBV envelope proteins and the HBV/HDV receptor NTCP. We found that HuH7-END cells release infectious HDV particles up to 400 million copies/milliliter and support virus spread to co-cultured cells. Due to the expression of NTCP, HuH7-END cells are also susceptible to de novo HDV entry. Virus production is stable for \u003e16 passages and can be scaled up for preparation of large HDV virus stocks. Finally, HuH7-END cells are suitable for screening of antiviral drugs targeting HDV replication. In summary, the HuH7-END cell line provides a novel tool to study HDV replication in vitro.","authors":"Yi Ni; Zhenfeng Zhang; Lisa Engelskircher; Georg Verch; Thomas Tu; Florian A.

{"abstract":"The mesenchymal gene program has been shown to promote the metastatic progression of ovarian cancer; however, specific proteins induced by this program that lead to these metastatic behaviors have not been identified. Using patient derived tumor cells and established human ovarian tumor cell lines, we find that the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition inducing factor TWIST1 drives expression of discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that recognizes fibrillar collagen as ligand. The expression and action of DDR2 was critical for mesothelial cell clearance, invasion and migration in ovarian tumor cells. It does so, in part, by upregulating expression and activity of matrix remodeling enzymes that lead to increased cleavage of fibronectin and spreading of tumor cells. Additionally, DDR2 stabilizes SNAIL1, allowing for sustained mesenchymal phenotype. In patient derived ovarian cancer specimens, DDR2 expression correlated with enhanced invasiveness. DDR2 expression was associated with advanced stage ovarian tumors and metastases. In vivo studies demonstrated that the presence of DDR2 is critical for ovarian cancer metastasis. These findings indicate that the collagen receptor DDR2 is critical for multiple steps of ovarian cancer progression to metastasis, and thus, identifies DDR2 as a potential new target for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer.","authors":"Whitney R.

{"abstract":"High entropy alloys (HEA) are a new type of high-performance structural material. Their vast degrees of compositional freedom provide for extensive opportunities to design alloys with tailored properties. However, compositional complexities present challenges for alloy design. Current approaches have shown limited reliability in accounting for the compositional regions of single solid solution and composite phases. For the first time, a phenomenological method analysing binary phase diagrams to predict HEA phases is presented. The hypothesis is that the HEA structural stability is encoded within the phase diagrams. Accordingly, we introduce several phase-diagram inspired parameters and employ machine learning (ML) to classify 600+ reported HEAs based on these parameters. Compared to other large database statistical prediction models, this model gives more detailed and accurate phase predictions. Both the overall HEA prediction and specifically single-phase HEA prediction rate are above 80%. To validate our method, we demonstrated its capability in predicting HEA solid solution phases with or without intermetallics in 42 randomly selected complex compositions, with a success rate of 81%. The presented search approach with high predictive capability can be exploited to interact with and complement other computation-intense methods such as CALPHAD in providing an accelerated and precise HEA design.","authors":"Jie Qi; Andrew M.

{"abstract":"Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), the key enzyme of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, has been reported to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis by upregulating the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. However, the profile of BCKDK in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains unknown. Here, we report a novel role of BCKDK in mCRC. BCKDK is upregulated in CRC tissues. Increased BCKDK expression was associated with metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of BCKDK decreased CRC cell migration and invasion ex vivo, and lung metastasis in vivo. BCKDK promoted the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, by decreasing the expression of E-cadherin, epithelial marker, and increasing the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, which are mesenchymal markers. Moreover, BCKDK-knockdown experiments in combination with phosphoproteomics analysis revealed the potent role of BCKDK in modulating multiple signal transduction pathways, including EMT and metastasis. Src phosphorylated BCKDK at the tyrosine 246 (Y246) site in vitro and ex vivo. Knockdown and knockout of Src downregulated the phosphorylation of BCKDK. Importantly, phosphorylation of BCKDK by Src enhanced the activity and stability of BCKDK, thereby promoting the migration, invasion, and EMT of CRC cells. In summary, the identification of BCKDK as a novel prometastatic factor in human CRC will be beneficial for further diagnostic biomarker studies and suggests novel targeting opportunities.","authors":"Qin Tian; Ping Yuan; Chuntao Quan; Mingyang Li; Juanjuan Xiao; Lu Zhang; Hui Lu; Tengfei Ma; Ling Zou; Fei Wang; Peipei Xue; Xiaofang Ni; Wei Wang; Lin Liu; Zhe Wang; Feng Zhu; Qiuhong Duan","keywords":"Gynaecological cancer; Metastasis; Oncogenes","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Tongji School of Pharmacy, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital and School of Basic Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Reproductive Health of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, Population and Family Planning Science and Technology Research Institute, Chongqing, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital and School of Basic Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","title":"Phosphorylation of BCKDK of BCAA catabolism at Y246 by Src promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer","id":"0f2b5532-926b-4dd8-b6f2-799b011e0eae"}
{"abstract":"Hybridization between species often leads to non-viable or infertile offspring, yet examples of evolutionarily successful interspecific hybrids have been reported in all kingdoms of life. However, many questions on the ecological circumstances and evolutionary aftermath of interspecific hybridization remain unanswered. In this study, we sequenced and phenotyped a large set of interspecific yeast hybrids isolated from brewing environments to uncover the influence of interspecific hybridization in yeast adaptation and domestication. Our analyses demonstrate that several hybrids between Saccharomyces species originated and diversified in industrial environments by combining key traits of each parental species. Furthermore, posthybridization evolution within each hybrid lineage reflects subspecialization and adaptation to specific beer styles, a process that was accompanied by extensive chimerization between subgenomes. Our results reveal how interspecific hybridization provides an important evolutionary route that allows swift adaptation to novel environments. Genomes and phenotypes of interspecific yeast hybrids isolated from breweries reveal hybridization between Saccharomyces species followed by adaptation to specific beer styles.","authors":"Brigida Gallone; Jan Steensels; Stijn Mertens; Maria C.

{"abstract":"Experiments in transgenic mouse models of early Alzheimer’s disease show that the amnesia seen at this stage of the disease is probably caused by a problem with memory retrieval from the hippocampus rather than an encoding defect. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of episodic memories, which are the first to go missing in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This study shows in transgenic mouse models of early Alzheimer's disease that the amnesia is due to a defect in memory retrieval rather than in encoding. Importantly, the 'forgotten' memories can be rescued by direct activation of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells, and the amnesia correlates with a progressive reduction of dentate gyrus engram cell spine density. The authors suggest that selective rescue of dentate gyrus engram cells and their spine density may lead to new therapeutic strategies to recoup lost memories in early Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory decline and subsequent loss of broader cognitive functions1. Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory, for which the hippocampus has a crucial role2. However, it has been uncertain whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia in these mice is age-dependent3,4,5, which correlates with a progressive reduction in spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating memory loss in the early stages of AD.","authors":"Dheeraj S. Roy; Autumn Arons; Teryn I.

{"abstract":"Laminins comprise structural components of basement membranes, critical in the regulation of differentiation, survival and migration of a diverse range of cell types, including skeletal muscle. Mutations in one muscle enriched Laminin isoform, Laminin alpha2 (Lama2), results in the most common form of congenital muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A). However, the exact cellular mechanism by which Laminin loss results in the pathological spectrum associated with MDC1A remains elusive. Here we show, via live tracking of individual muscle fibres, that dystrophic myofibres in the zebrafish model of MDC1A maintain sarcolemmal integrity and undergo dynamic remodelling behaviours post detachment, including focal sarcolemmal reattachment, cell extension and hyper-fusion with surrounding myoblasts. These observations imply the existence of a window of therapeutic opportunity, where detached cells may be “re-functionalised” prior to their delayed entry into the cell death program, a process we show can be achieved by muscle specific or systemic Laminin delivery. We further reveal that Laminin also acts as a pro-regenerative factor that stimulates muscle stem cell-mediated repair in lama2-deficient animals in vivo. The potential multi-mode of action of Laminin replacement therapy suggests it may provide a potent therapeutic axis for the treatment for MDC1A.","authors":"T. E. Hall; A. J. Wood; O. Ehrlich; M.

{"abstract":"Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) was approved for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease (PD) in December of 2013. Recently, further research has supported its use. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate the effects of CCH on penile curvature associated with Peyronie’s disease at our high volume institution. Since the approval of CCH for PD, 45 men have undergone between 1 and 4 treatment cycles (mean 3.13, standard deviation (SD) = 0.87) at our institution. Primary as well as secondary curvature, if any, was measured before beginning therapy and after each cycle of therapy. The degree of curvature was compared. We also questioned these men about their subjective experience with CCH. The mean age of this cohort was 55.7 years (range 35–70). The mean primary curvature was 53.6° (SD = 16.5). Post-treatment mean primary curvature was 48.2° (SD = 19.5), p = 0.10. Secondary curvature was reduced from 24.1° (SD = 11.3) to 20.4° (SD = 11.5) before and after treatment with CCH, respectively, p = 0.27. There were two tunical ruptures in this series after which both ceased therapy with CCH. Additionally, 37/45 patients in this series expressed some degree of dissatisfaction in their post-therapy visits with most of these men stating that they did not notice a change in their curvature. CCH remains an option for the treatment of PD. Predictors of success, however, are lacking. Our experience showed a less-robust response to CCH than previous studies and underscores the need for effective and clear patient counseling prior to the initiation of therapy with CCH for PD in the post-FDA-approval setting.","authors":"Peter N.

{"abstract":"Photoresponsive titania surfaces are of great interest due to their unique wettability change upon ultraviolet light illumination. However, their applications are often limited either by the inability to respond to visible light or the need for special treatment to recover the original wettability. Sensitizing TiO2 surfaces with visible light-absorbing materials has been utilized in photovoltaic applications. Here we demonstrate that a dye-sensitized TiO2 surface can selectively change the wettability towards contacting liquids upon visible light illumination due to a photo-induced voltage across the liquid and the underlying surface. The photo-induced wettability change of our surfaces enables external manipulation of liquid droplet motion upon illumination. We show demulsification of surfactant-stabilized brine-in-oil emulsions via coalescence of brine droplets on our dye-sensitized TiO2 surface upon visible light illumination. We anticipate that our surfaces will have a wide range of applications including microfluidic devices with customizable wettability, solar-driven oil–water clean-up and demulsification technologies. Controlling surface wettability using visible light is highly attractive for a range of liquid separation technologies. Here, Varanasi, McKinley and colleagues fabricate dye-sensitized photocatalytic TiO2surfaces on which liquid droplet motion can be externally manipulated by visible light illumination.","authors":"Gibum Kwon; Divya Panchanathan; Seyed Reza Mahmoudi; Mohammed A.

{"abstract":"Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons is one of few macroscopic quantum phenomena observed at room temperature. Since its discovery, it became an object of intense research, which led to the observation of many exciting phenomena such as quantized vortices, second sound, and Bogolyubov waves. However, it remained unclear what physical mechanisms can be responsible for the spatial stability of the magnon condensate. Indeed, since magnons are believed to exhibit attractive interaction, it is generally expected that the condensate is unstable with respect to the real-space collapse, contrarily to experimental findings. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence that magnons in a condensate exhibit repulsive interaction resulting in the condensate stabilization and propose a mechanism, which is responsible for this interaction. Our experimental conclusions are additionally supported by the theoretical model based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Our findings solve a long-standing problem, providing a new insight into the physics of magnon Bose-Einstein condensates. Little is known about the underlying mechanism responsible for the spatial stability of magnon Bose-Einstein condensates. Here experimental evidence is provided for a repulsive interaction of magnons in the condensate resulting in its stabilization.","authors":"I. V. Borisenko; B. Divinskiy; V. E. Demidov; G. Li; T.

{"abstract":"Taste-receptor cells use distinct semaphorins to guide wiring of the peripheral taste system; targeted ectopic expression of SEMA3A or SEMA7A leads to bitter neurons responding to sweet tastes or sweet neurons responding to bitter tastes. Taste cells experience a very rapid turnover, having life spans of only 5 to 20 days, but it is not yet known how the constantly replenishing taste cells re-establish appropriate connections with their respective ganglion neurons. Here, Charles Zuker and colleagues reveal that taste receptor cells make connections with neurons representing the same taste quality based on the different axon guidance molecules expressed by each taste receptor cell type. To demonstrate this molecular logic, the authors forced a sweet taste receptor cell to establish a connection with a bitter taste quality neuron simply through the ectopic expression of the bitter guidance molecule in the sweet taste receptor cell. These findings provide insights into how the gustatory system remains organized and specific despite experiencing cell turnover on such a large scale. In mammals, taste buds typically contain 50–100 tightly packed taste-receptor cells (TRCs), representing all five basic qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami1,2. Notably, mature taste cells have life spans of only 5–20 days and, consequently, are constantly replenished by differentiation of taste stem cells3. Given the importance of establishing and maintaining appropriate connectivity between TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons (that is, ensuring that a labelled line from sweet TRCs connects to sweet neurons, bitter TRCs to bitter neurons, sour to sour, and so on), we examined how new connections are specified to retain fidelity of signal transmission. Here we show that bitter and sweet TRCs provide instructive signals to bitter and sweet target neurons via different guidance molecules (SEMA3A and SEMA7A)4,5,6. We demonstrate that targeted expression of SEMA3A or SEMA7A in different classes of TRCs produces peripheral taste systems with miswired sweet or bitter cells. Indeed, we engineered mice with bitter neurons that now responded to sweet tastants, sweet neurons that responded to bitter or sweet neurons responding to sour stimuli. Together, these results uncover the basic logic of the wiring of the taste system at the periphery, and illustrate how a labelled-line sensory circuit preserves signalling integrity despite rapid and stochastic turnover of receptor cells.","authors":"Hojoon Lee; Lindsey J.

Here, we present a systematic micro-Raman study of two-dimensional flakes of n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 produced by the C/ME process, as a function of the flake thickness. We found Raman evidence for flakes with: (i) integer number of quintuples which exhibited a strong electron-phonon coupling, and (ii) non-integer number of quintuples, or sub-quintuples which exhibited the forbidden IR active mode due to symmetry lowering. Detailed atomic force microscopy was used to confirm the number of quintuples in all flakes examined in this study. The restacking and densification of these flakes by SPS promoted the formation of charged grain boundaries, which led to the enhanced TE properties via the energy filtering process.","authors":"Fengjiao Liu; Longyu Hu; Mehmet Karakaya; Pooja Puneet; Rahul Rao; Ramakrishna Podila; Sriparna Bhattacharya; Apparao M.

{"abstract":"A novel approach is employed to prepare the active layer of the forward osmosis membrane by the photo-polymerization method. The poly (ethylene glycol) phenyl ether acrylate (PPEA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as monomers. The emphasis is given to analysing the effect of monomer concentration on chemical functional groups of active layer, thermal stability, surface morphology, roughness, interfacial free energy, organic fouling tendency and osmotic flux performance. The functional groups of the active layer are characterized by ATR-FTIR. Furthermore, thermal analysis (TGA/DTG) is performed to calculate grafting density and thermal stability of prepared FO membranes. Surface morphology and roughness are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Unlike control polyamide active layer membrane that suffered from organic fouling (28.14 ± 3.70% flux decline and 95% flux recovery), the photo-polymerized 75/25 active layer FO membrane demonstrated the low fouling propensity (2.77 ± 0.62% flux decline) and high flux recovery (nearly ~100%). The interfacial free energy and low fouling property of 75/25 FO membrane is also reflected in improved osmotic flux performance with 11.20 ± 0.79 L/g (AL-FS) and 8.41 ± 0.22 L/g (AL-DS) reverse solute flux selectivity (RSFS) (Jw/Js) than control polyamide FO membrane (7.94 ± 0.22 L/g (AL-FS) and 7.64 ± 0.54 L/g (AL-DS)).","authors":"Pankaj M.

{"abstract":"The pearl oyster is one of the rare animal models that support two distinct genomes, through the surgical graft process operated for culture pearl production. This grafted organism is assimilated to a chimera whose physiological functioning remains poorly known. The question of the energy expenditure comparison between chimera and non-chimera animals arises. To answer this question, grafted and non-grafted pearl oysters were evaluated for their energetic needs by the indirect calorimetry method. This method made it possible to measure the energy expenditure based on the respiration rate (RR) measurement, reflecting the basal metabolism. The results showed that the RR values for grafted and non-grafted pearl oysters were not significantly different (p \u003c 0.05). The estimated cost of pearl calcification including CaCO3 and proteins synthesis was 0.237 ± 0.064 J h−1, representing 0.64% of the total energy expenditure of grafted pearl oysters.

{"abstract":"Managing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, e.g., dyslipidemia in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is critically important as CVD is the most common cause of death in T2DM patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of plant sterols (PS) on lowering both elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study, 161 individuals at increased risk of and with established T2DM, consumed low-fat spreads without or with added PS (2 g/d) for 6 weeks after a 2-week run-in period. Increased risk of developing T2DM was defined by the Australian T2DM Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK). Fasting serum/plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks. Effects on acute and chronic postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin were measured over 4-h in 39 individuals with T2DM following a mixed meal challenge without and with added 2 g/d PS at week 6. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02288585). Hundred fifty-one individuals completed the study and 138 (57% men, 43% women; 44 with and 94 at risk of T2DM) were included in per protocol analysis. Baseline LDL-C and TG were 3.8 ± 1.0 and 2.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l, respectively. PS intake significantly lowered fasting LDL-C (−4.6%, 95%CI −1.2; −8.0; p = 0.009), TC (−4.2%, 95%CI −1.2; −7.1; p = 0.006) and TG (−8.3%, 95% −1.1, −15.0; p = 0.024) with no significant changes in HDL-C, glucose or insulin. Postprandial lipid (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, remnant cholesterol), glucose and insulin responses did not differ. In individuals at risk of and with established T2DM and with elevated TG and LDL-C, 2 g/d of PS results in dual LDL-C plus TG lowering. Postprandial lipid or glycemic responses did not differ between PS and control treatment.","authors":"Elke A. Trautwein; Wieneke P. Koppenol; Arienne de Jong; Harry Hiemstra; Mario A.

{"abstract":"Identifying structural variation (SV) is essential for genome interpretation but has been historically difficult due to limitations inherent to available genome technologies. Detection methods that use ensemble algorithms and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled the discovery of thousands of SVs, uncovering information about their ubiquity, relationship to disease and possible effects on biological mechanisms. Given the variability in SV type and size, along with unique detection biases of emerging genomic platforms, multiplatform discovery is necessary to resolve the full spectrum of variation. Here, we review modern approaches for investigating SVs and proffer that, moving forwards, studies integrating biological information with detection will be necessary to comprehensively understand the impact of SV in the human genome. To map the full extent of structural variation in the human genome, detection methods are needed that improve on short-read approaches.

{"abstract":"High–harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been the main enabling technology of attosecond science since its discovery. Recently, HHG from solids has been demonstrated, opening a lively area of research. In contrast, harmonic generation from liquids has so far remained restricted to low harmonics in the visible regime. Here, we report the observation and detailed characterization of extreme ultraviolet HHG from liquid water and several alcohols extending beyond 20 eV. This advance was enabled by the implementation of the recent liquid flat–microjet technology, which we show to facilitate the spatial separation of HHG from the bulk liquid and the surrounding gas phase. We observe striking differences between the HHG spectra of water and several alcohols. A comparison with a strongly–driven few–band model establishes the sensitivity of HHG to the electronic structure of liquids. Our results suggest liquid–phase high–harmonic spectroscopy as a new method for studying the electronic structure and ultrafast scattering processes in liquids. While high–harmonic generation from gases, and more recently also from solids, has been extensively studied, there is little data on HHG from liquids. Here, Luu et al. experimentally demonstrate and study HHG up to 27th order from the bulk of liquid water and different alcohols.","authors":"Tran Trung Luu; Zhong Yin; Arohi Jain; Thomas Gaumnitz; Yoann Pertot; Jun Ma; Hans Jakob Wörner","keywords":"High-harmonic generation","organization_affiliated":"Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","title":"Extreme–ultraviolet high–harmonic generation in liquids","id":"bcb84f11-427f-4b9c-979a-7491c4d7b6c8"}
{"abstract":"The phytohormone 7-iso-(+)-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) mediates plant defense responses against herbivore and pathogen attack, and thus increases plant resistance against foreign invaders. However, JA-Ile also causes growth inhibition; and therefore JA-Ile is not a practical chemical regulator of plant defense responses. Here, we describe the rational design and synthesis of a small molecule agonist that can upregulate defense-related gene expression and promote pathogen resistance at concentrations that do not cause growth inhibition in Arabidopsis. By stabilizing interactions between COI1 and JAZ9 and JAZ10 but no other JAZ isoforms, the agonist leads to formation of JA-Ile co-receptors that selectively activate the JAZ9-EIN3/EIL1-ORA59 signaling pathway. The design of a JA-Ile agonist with high selectivity for specific protein subtypes may help promote the development of chemical regulators that do not cause a tradeoff between growth and defense. The phytohormone JA-Ile can promote plant resistance against herbivores and fungal pathogens but also inhibits growth, limiting its potential use in agriculture. Here, the authors design a stereoisomer of JA-Ile analog and demonstrate that it can promote defense while having minimal impact on growth.","authors":"Yousuke Takaoka; Mana Iwahashi; Andrea Chini; Hiroaki Saito; Yasuhiro Ishimaru; Syusuke Egoshi; Nobuki Kato; Maho Tanaka; Khurram Bashir; Motoaki Seki; Roberto Solano; Minoru Ueda","keywords":"Biotic; Jasmonic acid; Natural products","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Plant Molecular Genetics Department, National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Campus University Autonoma, Madrid, Spain; Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, RIKEN, Suita, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Plant Genomic Network Research Team, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Yokohama, Japan; Plant Genomic Network Research Team, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Yokohama, Japan; Plant Genomic Network Research Team, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Yokohama, Japan; Plant Molecular Genetics Department, National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Campus University Autonoma, Madrid, Spain; Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Molecular and Chemical Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan","title":"A rationally designed JAZ subtype-selective agonist of jasmonate perception","id":"f4f0cf98-1748-46b9-b9f6-20993b7f7829"}
{"abstract":"Cellular homeostasis relies on having dedicated and coordinated responses to a variety of stresses. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a common stress that triggers a conserved pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that mitigates damage, and dysregulation of UPR underlies several debilitating diseases. Here, we discover that a previously uncharacterized 54-amino acid microprotein PIGBOS regulates UPR. PIGBOS localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with the ER protein CLCC1 at ER–mitochondria contact sites. Functional studies reveal that the loss of PIGBOS leads to heightened UPR and increased cell death. The characterization of PIGBOS reveals an undiscovered role for a mitochondrial protein, in this case a microprotein, in the regulation of UPR originating in the ER. This study demonstrates microproteins to be an unappreciated class of genes that are critical for inter-organelle communication, homeostasis, and cell survival. Cells trigger an unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, but its regulation by mitochondria is unclear. Here, the authors report a 54-residue microprotein PIGBOS that participates in inter-organelle contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria and may regulate UPR.","authors":"Qian Chu; Thomas F.

{"abstract":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder affecting almost 40% of adult patients with epilepsy. Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common histopathological abnormality found in patients with MTLE. HS is characterised by extensive neuronal loss in different hippocampus sub-regions. In this study, we used laser microdissection-based microproteomics to determine the protein abundances in different regions and layers of the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) in an electric stimulation rodent model which displays classical HS damage similar to that found in patients with MTLE. Our results indicate that there are differences in the proteomic profiles of different layers (granule cell and molecular), as well as different regions, of the DG (ventral and dorsal). We have identified new signalling pathways and proteins present in specific layers and regions of the DG, such as PARK7, RACK1, and connexin 31/gap junction. We also found two major signalling pathways that are common to all layers and regions: inflammation and energy metabolism.

{"abstract":"The Amazonian landscape evolution is the result of the combined effect of Andean tectonism, climate and the Earth’s interior dynamics. To reconstruct the landscape evolution and its influence on paleoenvironmental variations within Amazonia since the Oligocene, we conducted numerical experiments that incorporate different surface and geodynamic processes, reproducing many paleogeographic features as inferred from the sedimentary record. We show that the evolution of the drainage pattern gradually reduced the area of sedimentation derived from the Guiana and Brazilian shields while expanded the Andean derived deposits during the Miocene, affecting the nutrient availability. First order biotic habitats were inferred from these paleogeographical reconstructions, showing an eastward expansion of várzea and terra firme forests and consequent retraction of igapó forests, with a millennial-scale reconfiguration of a mosaic of habitats in the lowlands. We conclude that this dynamism probably guided the observed patterns of speciation in the most biodiverse biome on Earth.","authors":"Tacio Cordeiro Bicudo; Victor Sacek; Renato Paes de Almeida; John M.

{"abstract":"The demand for rapid, consistent and easy-to-use techniques for detecting and identifying pathogens in various areas, such as clinical diagnosis, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental science and food inspection, is very important. In this study, the reference strains of six food-borne pathogens, namely, Escherichia coli 0157: H7 ATCC 43890, Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC 29004, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 43971, Staphylococcus aureus KCCM 40050, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 14579, and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, were chosen for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. In our study, the time-consuming sample preparation step for the microbial analysis under SEM was avoided, which makes this detection process notably rapid. Samples were loaded onto a 0.01-µm-thick silver (Ag) foil surface to avoid any charging effect. Two different excitation voltages, 10 kV and 5 kV, were used to determine the elemental information. Information obtained from SEM-EDX can distinguish individual single cells and detect viable and nonviable microorganisms. This work demonstrates that the combination of morphological and elemental information obtained from SEM-EDX analysis with the help of principal component analysis (PCA) enables the rapid identification of single microbial cells without following time-consuming microbiological cultivation methods.","authors":"Muhammad Saiful Islam Khan; Se-Wook Oh; Yun-Ji Kim","keywords":"Natural hazards; Pathogens","organization_affiliated":"Korea Food Research Institute, Consumer Safety Research Division, Wanju-Gun, Republic of Korea; Department of Food and Nutrition, Kookmin University, Seongbuk-gu, Republic of Korea; Korea Food Research Institute, Consumer Safety Research Division, Wanju-Gun, Republic of Korea; Department of Food Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea","title":"Power of Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis in Rapid Microbial Detection and Identification at the Single Cell Level","id":"c887e770-91db-4307-8491-5b333dd5eee1"}
{"abstract":"The conflict between pro-self and pro-social behaviour is at the core of many key problems of our time, as, for example, the reduction of air pollution and the redistribution of scarce resources. For the well-being of our societies, it is thus crucial to find mechanisms to promote pro-social choices over egoistic ones. Particularly important, because cheap and easy to implement, are those mechanisms that can change people’s behaviour without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives, the so-called “nudges”. Previous research has found that moral nudges (e.g., making norms salient) can promote pro-social behaviour. However, little is known about whether their effect persists over time and spills across context. This question is key in light of research showing that pro-social actions are often followed by selfish actions, thus suggesting that some moral manipulations may backfire. Here we present a class of simple moral nudges that have a great positive impact on pro-sociality. In Studies 1–4 (total N = 1,400), we use economic games to demonstrate that asking subjects to self-report “what they think is the morally right thing to do” does not only increase pro-sociality in the choice immediately after, but also in subsequent choices, and even when the social context changes. In Study 5, we explore whether moral nudges promote charity donations to humanitarian organisations in a large (N = 1,800) crowdfunding campaign. We find that, in this context, moral nudges increase donations by about 44 percent.","authors":"Valerio Capraro; Glorianna Jagfeld; Rana Klein; Mathijs Mul; Iris van de Pol","keywords":"Human behaviour; Social evolution","organization_affiliated":"Middlesex University of London, London, England; Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany; Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Universiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","title":"Increasing altruistic and cooperative behaviour with simple moral nudges","id":"4877b4d0-641c-46d1-8375-d9c5755ca065"}
{"abstract":"Total control over the electronic spin relaxation in molecular nanomagnets is the ultimate goal in the design of new molecules with evermore realizable applications in spin-based devices. For single-ion lanthanide systems, with strong spin–orbit coupling, the potential applications are linked to the energetic structure of the crystal field levels and quantum tunneling within the ground state. Structural engineering of the timescale of these tunneling events via appropriate design of crystal fields represents a fundamental challenge for the synthetic chemist, since tunnel splittings are expected to be suppressed by crystal field environments with sufficiently high-order symmetry. Here, we report the long missing study of the effect of a non-linear (C4) to pseudo-linear (D4d) change in crystal field symmetry in an otherwise chemically unaltered dysprosium complex. From a purely experimental study of crystal field levels and electronic spin dynamics at milliKelvin temperatures, we demonstrate the ensuing threefold reduction of the tunnel splitting. Suppression of quantum tunneling in molecular magnets is key for their magnetic behaviours to be exploitable. Here, the authors show that tuning the geometry of lanthanide single-ion magnets leads to a suppression of the quantum tunneling, finding a three-fold reduction of the tunnel splitting upon changing the crystal field symmetry.","authors":"Mikkel A.

{"abstract":"Poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-2 play an essential role in the DNA damage response. Based on this effect of PARP in the tumor cell itself, PARP inhibitors have emerged as new therapeutic tools both approved and in clinical trials. However, the interactome of multiple other cell types, particularly T cells, within the tumor microenvironment are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. Here, we bypassed the embryonic lethality of dually PARP-1/PARP-2-deficient mice by using a PARP-1-deficient mouse with a Cd4-promoter-driven deletion of PARP-2 in T cells to investigate the understudied role of these PARPs in the modulation of T cell responses against AT-3-induced breast tumors. We found that dual PARP-1/PARP-2-deficiency in T cells promotes tumor growth while single deficiency of each protein limited tumor progression. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells in dual PARP-1/PARP-2-deficiency host-mice revealed a global change in immunological profile and impaired recruitment and activation of T cells. Conversely, single PARP-1 and PARP-2-deficiency tends to produce an environment with an active and partially upregulated immune response. Our findings pinpoint opposite effects of single and dual PARP-1 and PARP-2-deficiency in modulating the antitumor response with an impact on tumor progression, and will have implications for the development of more selective PARP-centered therapies.","authors":"Lucia Moreno-Lama; Miguel A.

{"abstract":"Household air pollution (HAP) secondary to the burning of solid fuels is a major risk factor for the development of COPD. Our study seeks to examine the impact of a clean cookstove, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), on respiratory outcomes. Women (n = 200) from neighboring Indian communities, one cooking with LPG and one with biomass, were enrolled. Spirometry was performed. Relationships between primary cooking fuel and spirometry measures, as raw values, Global Lung Initiative (GLI) percent predicted (pp), and GLI z-scores, were examined using linear regression. Effect modification by age was explored. Women were young (average age 33.3 years), with low education (median 5.0 years), and the majority had multiple sources of air pollution exposures. Overall, the lung function in both groups was poor [FEV1 z-score median −2.05, IQR (−2.64, −1.41). Biomass was associated with lower FEV1/FVC (raw values −7.0, p = 0.04; GLI pp −7.62, p = 0.05, and z-score −0.86, p = 0.05) and FEF25–75 (GLI pp −25.78, p = 0.05, z-score −1.24, p = 0.05), after adjusting for confounders. Increasing impairment in lung function with age was found among biomass users (p-interaction = 0.01). In conclusion, use of a clean fuel cookstove may improve lung function. These findings have broad implications for research and public policy.","authors":"Sarmila Mazumder; Alison Lee; Brinda Dube; Divya Mehra; Phue Khaing; Sunita Taneja; Beizhan Yan; Steven N.

{"abstract":"A content-addressable memory compares an input search word against all rows of stored words in an array in a highly parallel manner. While supplying a very powerful functionality for many applications in pattern matching and search, it suffers from large area, cost and power consumption, limiting its use. Past improvements have been realized by using memristors to replace the static random-access memory cell in conventional designs, but employ similar schemes based only on binary or ternary states for storage and search. We propose a new analog content-addressable memory concept and circuit to overcome these limitations by utilizing the analog conductance tunability of memristors. Our analog content-addressable memory stores data within the programmable conductance and can take as input either analog or digital search values. Experimental demonstrations, scaled simulations and analysis show that our analog content-addressable memory can reduce area and power consumption, which enables the acceleration of existing applications, but also new computing application areas. Designing low power and high performance content-addressable memory remains a challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate a content-addressable memory concept and circuit which leverages the analog conductance tunability of memristors, reduces power consumption, and enables new functionalities and applications.","authors":"Can Li; Catherine E.

{"abstract":"Extraterrestrial iron sulfide is a major mineral reservoir of the cosmochemically and astrobiologically important elements iron and sulfur. Sulfur depletion on asteroids is a long-standing, yet unresolved phenomenon that is of fundamental importance for asteroid evolution and sulfur delivery to the Earth. Understanding the chemistry of such environments requires insight into the behavior of iron sulfides exposed to space. Here we show that troilite (FeS) grains recovered from the regolith of asteroid 25143 Itokawa have lost sulfur during long-term space exposure. We report the wide-spread occurrence of metallic iron whiskers as a decomposition product formed through irradiation of the sulfide by energetic ions of the solar wind. Whisker growth by ion irradiation is a novel and unexpected aspect of space weathering. It implies that sulfur loss occurs rapidly and, furthermore, that ion irradiation plays an important role in the redistribution of sulfur between solids and gas of the interstellar medium. The authors here investigate troilite (FeS) grains recovered from the regolith of asteroid Itokawa. Finding wide-spread occurrence of metallic iron whiskers, the authors suggest them to be a decomposition product formed through irradiation of the sulfide by energetic ions of the solar wind.","authors":"Toru Matsumoto; Dennis Harries; Falko Langenhorst; Akira Miyake; Takaaki Noguchi","keywords":"Asteroids, comets and Kuiper belt; Astronomy and planetary science","organization_affiliated":"Faculty of Arts and Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Institute of Geosciences, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany; Institute of Geosciences, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany; Institute of Geosciences, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany; Hawai’i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawai’i at Manoa, Honolulu, USA; Division of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwake-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto-shi, Japan; Faculty of Arts and Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","title":"Iron whiskers on asteroid Itokawa indicate sulfide destruction by space weathering","id":"33588164-6c2e-48a9-a008-45ab61bffd1f"}

Using high-resolution transcriptomics applied on CF sputum, we profile transcriptional phenotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations in patho-physiological conditions. Here we show that the soft-core genome of genetically distinct populations, while maintaining transcriptional flexibility, shares a common expression program tied to the lungs environment. We identify genetically independent traits defining P. aeruginosa physiology in vivo, documenting the connection between several previously identified mutations in CF isolates and some of the convergent phenotypes known to develop in later stages of the infection. In addition, our data highlight to what extent this organism can exploit its extensive repertoire of physiological pathways to acclimate to a new niche and suggest how alternative nutrients produced in the lungs may be utilized in unexpected metabolic contexts. How genetic adaptation and phenotypic acclimation are interrelated and allow Pseudomonas aeruginosa to persist in cystic fibrosis lungs is poorly understood.

{"abstract":"Global warming threatens community stability and biodiversity around the globe. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the responses to rising temperatures depends heavily on generic food-web models that do not account for changes in network structure along latitudes and temperature gradients. Using 124 marine rock-pool food webs sampled across four continents, we show that despite substantial variation in ambient temperature (mean 11.5–28.4 °C), similar empirical food-web and body-mass structures emerge. We have used dynamic modelling to test whether communities from warmer regions are more sensitive to warming and found a general hump-shaped relationship between simulated biodiversity and temperature (gradient from 0–50 °C). This implies that an expected anthropogenic global warming of 4 °C should increase biodiversity in arctic to temperate regions while biodiversity in tropical regions should decrease. Interestingly, simulations of synthetic networks did not yield similar results, which stresses the importance of considering the specificities of natural food webs for predicting community responses to environmental changes. Global warming will affect food-web structure and species persistence, and real world data is needed for better prediction. Combining species counts and temperature data from rock pools with dynamic modelling predicts biodiversity increases in arctic to temperate regions and declines in the tropics.","authors":"Benoit Gauzens; Björn C.

{"abstract":"Hypertension is an important public health problem in the world. Since the intermediate position of the gene expression between genotype and phenotype makes it suitable to link genotype to phenotype, we carried out a two-stage whole-genome gene expression association study to find differentially expressed genes and pathways for hypertension. In the first stage, 126 cases and 149 controls were used to find out the differentially expressed genes. In the second stage, an independent set of samples (127 cases and 150 controls) was used to validate the results. Additionally, we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to search for differentially affected pathways. A total of nine genes were implicated in the first stage (Bonferroni-corrected p-value \u003c 0.05). Among these genes, ZRANB1, FAM110A, PREP, ANKRD9 and LAMB2 were also differentially expressed in an existing database of hypertensive mouse model (GSE19817). A total of 16 pathways were identified by the GSEA. ZRANB1 and six pathways identified are related to TNF-α. Three pathways are related to interleukin, one to metabolic syndrome, and one to Hedgehog signaling. Identification of these genes and pathways suggest the importance of 1. inflammation, 2. visceral fat metabolism, and 3. adipocytes and osteocytes homeostasis in hypertension mechanisms and complications.","authors":"Kuang-Mao Chiang; Hsin-Chou Yang; Wen-Harn Pan","keywords":"Gene expression; Genome-wide association studies","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"A Two-Stage Whole-Genome Gene Expression Association Study of Young-Onset Hypertension in Han Chinese Population of Taiwan","id":"54b4a647-3651-4cfe-87af-57139bc4500b"}
{"abstract":"There is a critical need for better analytical methods to study mitochondria in normal and diseased states. Mitochondrial image analysis is typically done on still images using slow manual methods or automated methods of limited types of features. MitoMo integrated software overcomes these bottlenecks by automating rapid unbiased quantitative analysis of mitochondrial morphology, texture, motion, and morphogenesis and advances machine-learning classification to predict cell health by combining features. Our pixel-based approach for motion analysis evaluates the magnitude and direction of motion of: (1) molecules within mitochondria, (2) individual mitochondria, and (3) distinct morphological classes of mitochondria. MitoMo allows analysis of mitochondrial morphogenesis in time-lapse videos to study early progression of cellular stress. Biological applications are presented including: (1) establishing normal phenotypes of mitochondria in different cell types; (2) quantifying stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion in cells treated with an environmental toxicant, (3) tracking morphogenesis in mitochondria undergoing swelling, and (4) evaluating early changes in cell health when morphological abnormalities are not apparent. MitoMo unlocks new information on mitochondrial phenotypes and dynamics by enabling deep analysis of mitochondrial features in any cell type and can be applied to a broad spectrum of research problems in cell biology, drug testing, toxicology, and medicine.","authors":"Atena Zahedi; Vincent On; Rattapol Phandthong; Angela Chaili; Guadalupe Remark; Bir Bhanu; Prue Talbot","keywords":"Image processing; Machine learning; Mitochondria","organization_affiliated":"Graduate Program in Bioengineering, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Electrical \u0026 Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, USA; Graduate Program in Bioengineering, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Electrical \u0026 Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Computer Science, University of California, Riverside, USA; Graduate Program in Bioengineering, University of California, Riverside, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, USA","title":"Deep Analysis of Mitochondria and Cell Health Using Machine Learning","id":"c1d442e1-c725-4dcd-9088-e1113204472f"}
{"abstract":"New analyses reveal that TERRA transcripts arising from the subtelomeric pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of sex chromosomes nucleate pairing of X alleles in mouse ES cells. In mammals, homologous chromosomes rarely pair outside meiosis. One exception is the X chromosome, which transiently pairs during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). How two chromosomes find each other in 3D space is not known. Here, we reveal a required interaction between the X-inactivation center (Xic) and the telomere in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The subtelomeric, pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y) also undergo pairing in both female and male cells. PARs transcribe a class of telomeric RNA, dubbed PAR-TERRA, which accounts for a vast majority of all TERRA transcripts. PAR-TERRA binds throughout the genome, including to the PAR and Xic. During X-chromosome pairing, PAR-TERRA anchors the Xic to the PAR, creating a 'tetrad' of pairwise homologous interactions (Xic–Xic, PAR–PAR, and Xic–PAR). Xic pairing occurs within the tetrad. Depleting PAR-TERRA abrogates pairing and blocks initiation of XCI, whereas autosomal PAR-TERRA induces ectopic pairing. We propose a 'constrained diffusion model' in which PAR-TERRA creates an interaction hub to guide Xic homology searching during XCI.","authors":"Hsueh-Ping Chu; John E Froberg; Barry Kesner; Hyun Jung Oh; Fei Ji; Ruslan Sadreyev; Stefan F Pinter; Jeannie T Lee","keywords":"Chromosomes; Dosage compensation; Long non-coding RNAs","organization_affiliated":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Genetics and Genome Sciences, Institute for Systems Genomics, UConn Health, Farmington, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","title":"PAR-TERRA directs homologous sex chromosome pairing","id":"551cca16-ddf5-4c6a-b7da-0c942217bd22"}
{"abstract":"Only sparse epidemiological data are available regarding the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Here we aimed to describe the incidence and predictors of IS associated with CABG performed after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as well as trends over time. We analyzed data for 248,925 unselected AMI patients. We separately analyzed groups of patients who underwent CABG early or late after the index infarction. IS incidence rates per year at risk were 15.8% (95% confidence interval, 14.5–17.1) and 10.9% (10.6–11.2), respectively, among patients with and without CABG in the early cohort, and 4.0% (3.5–4.5) and 2.3% (2.2–2.3), respectively, among patients with and without CABG in the late cohort. Predictors of post-AMI IS included prior IS, CABG, prior atrial fibrillation, prior hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure during hospitalization, older age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Reduced IS risk was associated with use of statins and P2Y12 inhibitors. IS incidence markedly decreased among patients who did not undergo CABG, while no such reduction over time occurred among those who underwent CABG. This emphasizes the need to optimize modifiable risk factors and to consistently use treatments that may reduce IS risk among CABG patients.","authors":"André Åström; Lars Söderström; Thomas Mooe","keywords":"Acute coronary syndromes; Interventional cardiology; Preventive medicine; Risk factors; Vascular diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden; Unit of Research, Education and Development, Östersund Hospital, Östersund, Sweden; Professor, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Östersund, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden","title":"Risk of Ischemic Stroke After Acute Myocardial Infarction in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery","id":"55d97965-0e82-4204-83a2-9f62b60744a4"}
{"abstract":"Plasma genotyping identifies potentially actionable mutations at variable mutant allele frequencies, often admixed with multiple subclonal variants, highlighting the need for their clinical and functional validation. We prospectively monitored plasma genotypes in 143 women with endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC), identifying multiple novel mutations including HER2 mutations (8.4%), albeit at different frequencies highlighting clinical heterogeneity. To evaluate functional significance, we established ex vivo culture from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a patient with HER2-mutant MBC, which revealed resistance to multiple targeted therapies including endocrine and CDK 4/6 inhibitors, but high sensitivity to neratinib (IC50: 0.018 μM). Immunoblotting analysis of the HER2-mutant CTC culture line revealed high levels of HER2 expression at baseline were suppressed by neratinib, which also abrogated downstream signaling, highlighting oncogenic dependency with HER2 mutation. Furthermore, treatment of an index patient with HER2-mutant MBC with the irreversible HER2 inhibitor neratinib resulted in significant clinical response, with complete molecular resolution of two distinct clonal HER2 mutations, with persistence of other passenger subclones, confirming HER2 alteration as a driver mutation. Thus, driver HER2 mutant alleles that emerge during blood-based monitoring of endocrine-resistant MBC confer novel therapeutic vulnerability, and ex vivo expansion of viable CTCs from the blood circulation may broadly complement plasma-based mutational analysis in MBC.","authors":"Arielle J.

{"abstract":"Removal of synaptically-released glutamate by astrocytes is necessary to spatially and temporally limit neuronal activation. Recent evidence suggests that astrocytes may have specialized functions in specific circuits, but the extent and significance of such specialization are unclear. By performing direct patch-clamp recordings and two-photon glutamate imaging, we report that in the somatosensory cortex, glutamate uptake by astrocytes is slower during sustained synaptic stimulation when compared to lower stimulation frequencies. Conversely, glutamate uptake capacity is increased in the frontal cortex during higher frequency synaptic stimulation, thereby limiting extracellular buildup of glutamate and NMDA receptor activation in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. This efficient glutamate clearance relies on Na+/K+-ATPase function and both GLT-1 and non-GLT-1 transporters. Thus, by enhancing their glutamate uptake capacity, astrocytes in the frontal cortex may prevent excessive neuronal excitation during intense synaptic activity. These results may explain why diseases associated with network hyperexcitability differentially affect individual brain areas. Jennifer Romanos et al. investigate how differences in astrocyte-mediated glutamate clearance between the frontal and somatosensory cortex impact neuronal function. They find that the frontal cortex more efficiently clears glutamate when synaptic stimulation frequency is high and this may prevent excessive neuronal excitation during sustained synaptic activity.","authors":"Jennifer Romanos; Dietmar Benke; Aiman S.

{"abstract":"Moiré superlattices (MSLs) are modulated structures produced from homogeneous or heterogeneous 2D layers stacked with a twist angle and/or lattice mismatch. Expanding the range of available materials, methods for fabricating MSL, and realization of unique emergent properties are key challenges. Here we report a facile bottom-up synthesis of homogeneous MSL based on a wide-gap 2D semiconductor, BiOCl, using a one-pot solvothermal approach with robust reproducibility. Unlike previous MSLs usually prepared by directly stacking two monolayers, our BiOCl MSLs are realized in a scalable, direct way through chemical growth of spiral-type nanosheets driven by screw-dislocations. We find emergent properties including large band gap reduction (∼0.6 eV), two-fold increase in carrier lifetime, and strongly enhanced photocatalytic activity. First-principles calculations reveal that such unusual properties can be ascribed to the locally enhanced inter-layer coupling associated with the Moiré potential modulation. Our results demonstrate the promise of MSL materials for chemical and physical functions.

{"abstract":"Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) have gained attention as a novel physical stimulus for life sciences. Although cancer therapy is currently their promising application, nsPEFs have further potential owing to their ability to elicit various cellular responses. This study aimed to explore stimulatory actions of nsPEFs, and we used HL-60 cells that were differentiated into neutrophils under cultured conditions. Exposure of neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells to nsPEFs led to the extracellular release of chromosomal DNA, which appears to be equivalent to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that serve as a host defense mechanism against pathogens. Fluorometric measurement of extracellular DNA showed that DNA extrusion was rapidly induced after nsPEF exposure and increased over time. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nsPEFs induced histone citrullination that is the hydrolytic conversion of arginine to citrulline on histones and facilitates chromatin decondensation. DNA extrusion and histone citrullination by nsPEFs were cell type-specific and Ca2+-dependent events. Taken together, these observations suggest that nsPEFs drive the mechanism for neutrophil-specific immune response without infection, highlighting a novel aspect of nsPEFs as a physical stimulus.","authors":"Tsubasa Koga; Keiko Morotomi-Yano; Takashi Sakugawa; Hisato Saitoh; Ken-ichi Yano","keywords":"Biophysics; Cell biology","organization_affiliated":"Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology (FAST), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Institute of Pulsed Power Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","title":"Nanosecond pulsed electric fields induce extracellular release of chromosomal DNA and histone citrullination in neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells","id":"08ade05c-13d5-475e-b8b3-87828f5f73b5"}
{"abstract":"Phagocytosis is a process in which target cells or particles are engulfed and taken up by other cells, typically professional phagocytes; this process is crucial in many physiological processes and disease states. The detection of targets for phagocytosis is directed by a complex repertoire of cell surface receptors. Pattern recognition receptors directly detect targets for binding and uptake, while opsonic and complement receptors detect objects coated by soluble factors. However, the importance of single and combinatorial surface marker expression across different phenotypes of professional phagocytes is not known. Here we developed a novel mass cytometry-based phagocytosis assay that enables the simultaneous detection of phagocytic events in combination with up to 40 other protein markers. We applied this assay to distinct monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) populations and found that prototypic M2-like MDMs phagocytose more E. coli than M1-like MDMs. Surface markers such as CD14, CD206, and CD163 rendered macrophages phagocytosis competent, but only CD209 directly correlated with the amount of particle uptake. Similarly, M2-like MDMs also phagocytosed more cancer cells than M1-like MDMs but, unlike M1-like MDMs, were insensitive to anti-CD47 opsonization. Our approach facilitates the simultaneous study of single-cell phenotypes, phagocytic activity, signaling and transcriptional events in complex cell mixtures.","authors":"Daniel Schulz; Yannik Severin; Vito Riccardo Tomaso Zanotelli; Bernd Bodenmiller","keywords":"Immunological techniques; Innate immunity","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular System Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich), Zürich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Systems Biology PhD Program, Life Science Zürich Graduate School, ETH Zürich and University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","title":"In-Depth Characterization of Monocyte-Derived Macrophages using a Mass Cytometry-Based Phagocytosis Assay","id":"bcebe902-c21f-4bc6-a336-1c52ea055f52"}

Information in neural networks and cell-substrate interactions have been heretofore studied separately. Understanding whether surface nano-topography can direct nerve cells assembly into computational efficient networks may provide new tools and criteria for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this work, we used information theory approaches and functional multi calcium imaging (fMCI) techniques to examine how information flows in neural networks cultured on surfaces with controlled topography. We found that substrate roughness S a affects networks topology. In the low nano-meter range, S a  = 0–30 nm, information increases with S a . Moreover, we found that energy density of a network of cells correlates to the topology of that network. This reinforces the view that information, energy and surface nano-topography are tightly inter-connected and should not be neglected when studying cell-cell interaction in neural tissue repair and regeneration.","authors":"V.

{"abstract":"Evolutionary change is the change in trait values across generations, and usually occurs in multidimensional trait space rather than along isolated traits. Genetic covariation influences the magnitude and direction of evolutionary change and can be statistically summarized by the additive genetic (co)variance matrix, G. While G can affect the response to selection, it is exposed to evolutionary change by selection and genetic drift, but the magnitude and speed of these changes are poorly understood. We use comparative G matrix analyses to assess evolution of the shape and orientation of G over longer timescales in three species of Gomphocerine grasshoppers. We estimate 10 × 10 G matrices for five morphological traits expressed in both sexes. We find low-to-moderate heritabilities (average 0.36), mostly large cross-sex correlations (average 0.54) and moderate between-trait correlations (average 0.34). G matrices differ significantly among species with wing length contributing most to these differences. Wing length is the trait that is most divergent among species, suggesting it has been under selection during species divergence. The more distantly related species, Pseudochorthippus parallelus, was the most different in the shape of G. Projection of contemporary genetic variation into the divergence space D illustrates that the major axis of genetic variation in Gomphocerippus rufus is aligned with divergence from Chorthippus biguttulus, while the major axis of genetic variation in neither of the species is aligned with the divergence between Pseudochorthippus parallelus and the other two species. Our results demonstrate significant differences in G matrices with a phylogenetic signal in the differentiation.","authors":"Anasuya Chakrabarty; Holger Schielzeth","keywords":"Evolutionary genetics; Quantitative trait","organization_affiliated":"Department of Evolutionary Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany; Population Ecology Group, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany; Population Ecology Group, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany","title":"Comparative analysis of the multivariate genetic architecture of morphological traits in three species of Gomphocerine grasshoppers","id":"5444c454-ea7e-45e1-9390-4a272a0a82c5"}
{"abstract":"Microtubules are filamentous structures necessary for cell division, motility and morphology, with dynamics critically regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Here we outline the molecular mechanism by which the MAP, COMPANION OF CELLULOSE SYNTHASE1 (CC1), controls microtubule bundling and dynamics to sustain plant growth under salt stress. CC1 contains an intrinsically disordered N-terminus that links microtubules at evenly distributed points through four conserved hydrophobic regions. By NMR and live cell analyses we reveal that two neighboring residues in the first hydrophobic binding motif are crucial for the microtubule interaction. The microtubule-binding mechanism of CC1 is reminiscent to that of the prominent neuropathology-related protein Tau, indicating evolutionary convergence of MAP functions across animal and plant cells. The Arabidopsis CC1 protein maintains microtubule array stability and cellulose synthesis during salt stress. Here the authors show that CC1 engages microtubules via an intrinsically disordered N-terminus that suggests it controls microtubule dynamics in a similar way to the mammalian Tau protein.","authors":"Christopher Kesten; Arndt Wallmann; René Schneider; Heather E.

{"abstract":"Proton transfer involving site-specific hydrogen-bonding interactions is one of the most fundamental and important reactions in chemistry and biology. Deliberately triggering this reaction by photoexcitation enables unique and insightful mechanistic analyses. This Review describes a particularly effective method that involves exciting a photoacid containing both an amine and a basic residue and monitoring the ensuing excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) reactions. Replacing a H atom on the amine with another substituent R modulates the acidity of the amine and allows for the excited-state hydrogen-bond strength to be tuned over a very broad range. In this way, one can draw empirical correlations between N−H bond distances, acidity, hydrogen-bond strength and the ESIPT kinetics and thermodynamics. For example, stronger intramolecular N−H···N hydrogen bonding leads to faster and more exergonic ESIPT. Tuning the amine and basic residues allows one to switch the ESIPT mechanism between the kinetic and thermodynamic regimes, such that molecules can generate ratiometric emission, which is suitable for white-light generation and two-colour imaging. The identity of the amine substituent R not only affects the acidity but can be differentially sensitive towards the local chemical environment. Thus, the R group transduces environmental changes into modified ESIPT rates and/or mechanisms. Such studies open new frontiers in the fundamental aspects of proton transfer in amines, as well as their largely unexplored potential applications. This Review describes excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) reactions with amines as proton donors. Systematic variation of N−H bond strength, acidity and reaction rate enables ESIPT kinetics and thermodynamics to be correlated and new molecules to be designed for sensing and optoelectronics applications.

{"abstract":"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves membrane-associated scaffolds of the bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domain protein family as well as the GTPase dynamin, and is accompanied and perhaps triggered by changes in local lipid composition. How protein recruitment, scaffold assembly and membrane deformation is spatiotemporally controlled and coupled to fission is poorly understood. We show by computational modelling and super-resolution imaging that phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] synthesis within the clathrin-coated area of endocytic intermediates triggers selective recruitment of the PX-BAR domain protein SNX9, as a result of complex interactions of endocytic proteins competing for phospholipids. The specific architecture induces positioning of SNX9 at the invagination neck where its self-assembly regulates membrane constriction, thereby providing a template for dynamin fission. These data explain how lipid conversion at endocytic pits couples local membrane constriction to fission. Our work demonstrates how computational modelling and super-resolution imaging can be combined to unravel function and mechanisms of complex cellular processes. The spatiotemporal regulation of membrane scaffolds recruitment and coupling between membrane deformation and fission in endocytosis are unclear. Here the authors show that lipid conversion at endocytic pits recruits SNX9, which couples local membrane constriction to fission in endocytosis.","authors":"Johannes Schöneberg; Martin Lehmann; Alexander Ullrich; York Posor; Wen-Ting Lo; Gregor Lichtner; Jan Schmoranzer; Volker Haucke; Frank Noé","keywords":"Computational models; Endocytosis; Membrane fission","organization_affiliated":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Present address: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA, ; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Present address: Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Virchowweg 6, 10117 Berlin, Germany, ; Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany","title":"Lipid-mediated PX-BAR domain recruitment couples local membrane constriction to endocytic vesicle fission","id":"194ec4c8-4767-49d5-bba2-08fa251ab6a6"}
{"abstract":"Several types of nonconventional dysplasia have been recently described in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, strict morphologic criteria are lacking, and their clinicopathologic features (including potential association with conventional dysplasia and/or colorectal cancer [CRC]) are poorly understood. A total of 106 dysplastic or serrated lesions in 58 IBD patients with CRC were retrospectively identified from five institutions. Thirty-six cases of nonconventional dysplasia were identified in 26 (45%) of the 58 patients and occurred with similar frequency in men and women (58% and 42%, respectively), with a mean age of 54 years (range: 24–73) and a long history of IBD (mean: 17 years, range: 2–43). Six morphologic patterns were recognized. Hypermucinous dysplasia (n = 15; 42%) presented as either a ‘pure type’ (n = 5; 14%) or a ‘mixed type’ with either conventional or another nonconventional subtype (n = 10; 28%). Serrated lesions, as a group, were equally common (n = 15; 42%) and included three variants: traditional serrated adenoma-like (n = 10; 28%), sessile serrated lesion-like (n = 1; 3%), and serrated lesion, not otherwise specified (n = 4; 11%). Dysplastic lesions with increased Paneth cell differentiation (n = 4; 11%) and goblet cell deficient dysplasia (n = 2; 6%) were rare. Twelve (46%) of the 26 patients had only nonconventional dysplasia, whereas the remaining 14 patients (54%) had both nonconventional and conventional dysplasias. Nonconventional dysplasia was most often graded as low-grade dysplasia (81%), which was less common in conventional dysplasia (37%) (p = 0.003). When present alone, nonconventional dysplasia was predominantly found in the left colon (81%, p = 0.006) as a polypoid or raised lesion (75%, p \u003c 0.001) compared with when it occurred simultaneously with conventional dysplasia (35% and 50%, respectively). When both nonconventional and conventional dysplasias occurred simultaneously, they were found in the same colonic segment in all but 3 patients (79%). Nonconventional dysplasia was also commonly detected in the same colonic segment as CRC or immediately adjacent to the CRC at a rate (85%) similar to conventional dysplasia (96%). CRC occurring in patients with only nonconventional dysplasia was more likely to be high-grade (poorly differentiated; 36%) than CRC that occurred in association with conventional dysplasia (10%) (p = 0.026). In conclusion, nonconventional dysplasia is common in IBD patients with CRC. It appears to develop in the same field of carcinomatous development, and it is not uncommonly associated with conventional dysplasia.","authors":"Won-Tak Choi; Masato Yozu; Gregory C.

{"abstract":"Attractive people are perceived to be healthier, wealthier, and more sociable. Yet, people often judge the attractiveness of others based on incomplete and inaccurate facial information. Here, we test the hypothesis that people fill in the missing information with positive inferences when judging others’ facial beauty. To test this hypothesis, we conducted seven experiments where participants judged the attractiveness of human faces in complete and incomplete photographs. Our data shows that—relative to complete photographs—participants judge faces in incomplete photographs as physically more attractive. This positivity bias is replicated for different types of incompleteness; is mostly specific to aesthetic judgments; is stronger for male participants; is specific to human faces when compared to pets, flowers, and landscapes; seems to involve a holistic processing; and is stronger for atypical faces. These findings contribute to our understanding of how people perceive and make inferences about others’ beauty.","authors":"Diana Orghian; César A.

{"abstract":"In zebrafish, the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the inflammatory phase of heart regeneration following cryoinjury remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated an increase in MMP enzymatic activity and elevated expression of mmp9 and mmp13 in the injured area (IA) of hearts from as early as 1 day post-cryoinjury (dpc). Treatment with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, GM6001, during the first week after cryoinjury resulted in impaired heart regeneration, as indicated by the larger scar and reduced numbers of proliferating cardiomyocytes. GM6001 also significantly reduced the number of leukocytes to the IA at 0.5 dpc to 4 dpc. Specific inhibition of both MMP-9 and MMP-13 also resulted in impaired regeneration and leukocyte recruitment. However, chemokine rescue with recombinant CXCL8 and CCL2 restored the recruitment of macrophages and the cardiac regenerative capability in GM6001-treated fish. MMP-9 and MMP-13 cleaved zebrafish CXCL8 at the same site, and the truncated form was more chemotactic than the intact form. In contrast, CCL2 did not have an MMP-9 or MMP-13 cleavage site. Together, these data suggest that MMPs might play a key role in the inflammatory phase of heart regeneration in zebrafish, by mediating leukocyte recruitment via the activation of chemokines.","authors":"Shisan Xu; Sarah E.

{"abstract":"Midbrain dopamine neurons are well known for their role in reward-based reinforcement learning. We found that the activity of dopamine axons in the posterior tail of the striatum (TS) scaled with the novelty and intensity of external stimuli, but did not encode reward value. We demonstrated that the ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons specifically inhibited avoidance of novel or high-intensity stimuli without affecting animals’ initial avoidance responses, suggesting a role in reinforcement rather than simply in avoidance itself. Furthermore, we found that animals avoided optogenetic activation of dopamine axons in TS during a choice task and that this stimulation could partially reinstate avoidance of a familiar object. These results suggest that TS-projecting dopamine neurons reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli. More generally, our results indicate that there are at least two axes of reinforcement learning using dopamine in the striatum: one based on value and one based on external threat. Menegas et al. show that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli. Their results indicate that there are two axes of reinforcement learning using dopamine, the value axis and the threat axis.","authors":"William Menegas; Korleki Akiti; Ryunosuke Amo; Naoshige Uchida; Mitsuko Watabe-Uchida","keywords":"Decision; Neural circuits; Operant learning; Striatum","organization_affiliated":"Center for Brain Science, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; Center for Brain Science, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; Center for Brain Science, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; Center for Brain Science, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; Center for Brain Science, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","title":"Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli","id":"565b6f6c-6284-4a88-ad26-a6aad95b685a"}
{"abstract":"Antigen (Ag)-mediated crosslinking of IgE-loaded high-affinity receptors for IgE (FcεRI) on mast cells (MCs) triggers activation of proinflammatory effector functions relevant for IgE-associated allergic disorders. The cytosolic tyrosine kinase BTK and the SH2-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase SHIP1 are central positive and negative regulators of Ag-triggered MC activation, respectively, contrarily controlling Ca2+ mobilisation, degranulation, and cytokine production. Using genetic and pharmacological techniques, we examined whether BTK activation in Ship1−/− MCs is mandatory for the manifestation of the well-known hyperactive phenotype of Ship1−/− MCs. We demonstrate the prominence of BTK for the Ship1−/− phenotype in a manner strictly dependent on the strength of the initial Ag stimulus; particular importance for BTK was identified in Ship1−/− bone marrow-derived MCs in response to stimulation with suboptimal Ag concentrations. With respect to MAPK activation, BTK showed particular importance at suboptimal Ag concentrations, allowing for an analogous-to-digital switch resulting in full activation of ERK1/2 already at low Ag concentrations. Our data allow for a more precise definition of the role of BTK in FcεRI-mediated signal transduction and effector function in MCs. Moreover, they suggest that reduced activation or curtate expression of SHIP1 can be compensated by pharmacological inhibition of BTK and vice versa.","authors":"Carolin N.

{"abstract":"Although advances in neuroimaging have yielded insights into the intrinsic organization of human brain networks and their relevance to psychiatric and neurological disorders, there has been no translation of these insights into clinical practice. One necessary step toward clinical translation is identifying a summary metric of network function that is reproducible, reliable, and has known normative data, analogous to normed neuropsychological tests. Our aim was therefore to establish the proof of principle for such a metric, focusing on the default mode network (DMN). We compared three candidate summary metrics: global clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and average connectivity. Across three samples totaling 322 healthy, mostly Caucasian adults, average connectivity performed best, with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.69–0.70) and adequate eight-week test–retest reliability (intra-class coefficient=0.62 in a subsample N=65). We therefore present normative data for average connectivity of the DMN and its sub-networks. These proof of principle results are an important first step for the translation of neuroimaging to clinical practice. Ultimately, a normed summary metric will allow a single patient’s DMN function to be quantified and interpreted relative to normative peers.","authors":"T M Ball; A N Goldstein-Piekarski; J M Gatt; L M Williams","keywords":"Diagnostic markers; Psychology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA; Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia; School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA","title":"Quantifying person-level brain network functioning to facilitate clinical translation","id":"8961502f-669f-4905-ba2a-f33de8019d1f"}
{"abstract":" Ulocladium was thought to be a strictly asexual genus of filamentous fungi. However, Ulocladium strains were shown to possess both MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes as observed in homothallic filamentous Ascomycetes. Here, we demonstrate that the U. botrytis MAT genes play essential roles for controlling asexual traits (conidial size and number). Using reciprocal genetic transformation, we demonstrate that MAT genes from the related heterothallic species Cochliobolus heterostrophus can also influence U. botrytis colony growth, conidial number and size, and have a strong effect on the range of the number of septa/conidium. Moreover, U. botrytis MAT genes can also affect similar aspects of asexual reproduction when expressed in C. heterostrophus. Heterologous complementation using C. heterostrophus MAT genes shows that they have lost the ability to regulate sexual reproduction in U. botrytis, under the conditions we employed, while the reciprocal heterologous complementation demonstrates that U. botrytis MAT genes have the ability to partially induce sexual reproduction in C. heterostrophus. Thus, the genetic backgrounds of C. heterostrophus and U. botrytis play significant roles in determining the function of MAT genes on sexual reproduction in these two fungi species. These data further support the role of MAT genes in controlling asexual growth in filamentous Ascomycetes but also confirm that heterothallic and homothallic Dothideomycete fungi can be interconverted by the exchange of MAT genes.","authors":"Qun Wang; Shi Wang; Chen Lin Xiong; Timothy Y.

{"abstract":"In real paramagnets, there is always a subtle many-body contribution to the system’s energy, which can be regarded as a small effective local magnetic field (Bloc). Usually, it is neglected, since it is very small when compared with thermal fluctuations and/or external magnetic fields (B). Nevertheless, as both the temperature (T) → 0 K and B → 0 T, such many-body contributions become ubiquitous. Here, employing the magnetic Grüneisen parameter (Γmag) and entropy arguments, we report on the pivotal role played by the mutual interactions in the regime of ultra-low-T and vanishing B. Our key results are: i) absence of a genuine zero-field quantum phase transition due to the presence of Bloc; ii) connection between the canonical definition of temperature and Γmag; and iii) possibility of performing adiabatic magnetization by only manipulating the mutual interactions. Our findings unveil unprecedented aspects emerging from the mutual interactions.","authors":"Lucas Squillante; Isys F. Mello; Gabriel O. Gomes; A. C. Seridonio; R. E. Lagos-Monaco; H.

{"abstract":"Ionic liquids are promising candidates for electrolytes in energy-storage systems. We demonstrate that mixing two ionic liquids allows to precisely tune their physical properties, like the dc conductivity. Moreover, these mixtures enable the gradual modification of the fragility parameter, which is believed to be a measure of the complexity of the energy landscape in supercooled liquids. The physical origin of this index is still under debate; therefore, mixing ionic liquids can provide further insights. From the chemical point of view, tuning ionic liquids via mixing is an easy and thus an economic way. For this study, we performed detailed investigations by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry on two mixing series of ionic liquids. One series combines an imidazole based with a pyridine based ionic liquid and the other two different anions in an imidazole based ionic liquid. The analysis of the glass-transition temperatures and the thorough evaluations of the measured dielectric permittivity and conductivity spectra reveal that the dynamics in mixtures of ionic liquids are well defined by the fractions of their parent compounds.","authors":"E.

{"abstract":"We describe here an interrupted reprogramming strategy to generate “induced progenitor-like (iPL) cells” from alveolar epithelial type II (AEC-II) cells. A carefully defined period of transient expression of reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM)) is able to rescue the limited in vitro clonogenic capacity of AEC-II cells, potentially by activation of a bipotential progenitor-like state. Importantly, our results demonstrate that interrupted reprogramming results in controlled expansion of cell numbers yet preservation of the differentiation pathway to the alveolar epithelial lineage. When transplanted to the injured lungs, AEC-II-iPL cells are retained in the lung and ameliorate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Interrupted reprogramming can be used as an alternative approach to produce highly specified functional therapeutic cell populations and may lead to significant advances in regenerative medicine. A modified reprogramming strategy helps expand populations of surfactant-producing lung cells in a dish without altering their cellular function. A team led by Thomas Waddell and Andras Nagy from the University of Toronto, Canada isolated alveolar type II cells from the lungs of mice. They transiently induced expression of four reprogramming factors in these cells for a defined period of time. Before this “interrupted” reprogramming, the lung cells had limited ability to continue replicating themselves. Afterwards, the cells could expand their numbers dramatically without entering a pluripotent state. Rather, the cells maintained their original function while also expressing genes associated with lung precursor cells, which could explain their proliferative ability. The cells, when transplanted into the injured lungs, helped ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model, suggesting that a similar cell-based therapy may be useful in people.","authors":"Li Guo; Golnaz Karoubi; Pascal Duchesneau; Fabio Gava Aoki; Maria V.

{"abstract":"In the epoch of the Anthropocene change, complexity, and uncertainty create a demand for new systems of water management and governance. One such management model that is rapidly gaining traction amongst both scholars and practitioners is the concept of water resilience. Although increasing attention has been paid to the overarching theoretical and applied issues surrounding water resilience, few have examined individual attitudes and perceptions towards this concept. In this paper, we examine to what extent individuals endorse – that is, agree with and see the importance of using - social-ecological resilience as a framework for management and governance of water resources. We approach the problem and promise of water governance in this way because individuals’ mindsets (and shifts in mindsets) offers one of the most effective leverage points for larger system change. To explore water resilience endorsement, we developed a scale (i.e., a water resilience scale) that was designed to capture individual endorsement of each of the seven principles of social-ecological water resilience. Three additional sets of questionnaires were also used to examine whether individual characteristics (i.e., demographics, psychological factors, and environmental attitudes) predict water resilience endorsement. Overall, there was considerable societal endorsement of water resilience. However, the degree to which individuals endorsed the concept of water resilience differed as a function of demographics, psychological characteristics, and attitudes toward the environment. Future research should examine the nuances of endorsement and consider targeted approaches to influence endorsement levels by using the predictor variables as a basis for engaging and shifting mindsets.","authors":"Julia Baird; Gillian Dale; Sherman Farhad","keywords":"Psychology and behaviour; Sustainability","organization_affiliated":"Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, Brock University, Ontario, Canada; Department of Geography and Tourism Studies, Brock University, Ontario, Canada; Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, Brock University, Ontario, Canada; Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, Brock University, Ontario, Canada","title":"Individual differences predict endorsement of water resilience","id":"eddb202c-c80c-488f-84ca-ff8fe1936296"}
{"abstract":"The role of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in regulating nicotine taking and seeking remains largely unexplored. In this study we took advantage of the high time-resolution of optogenetic intervention by decreasing (Arch3.0) or increasing (ChR2) the activity of neurons in the dorsal and ventral mPFC during 5-s nicotine cue presentations in order to evaluate their contribution to cued nicotine seeking and taking. Wistar rats were trained to self-administer intravenous nicotine in 1 h self-administration sessions twice a day for a minimum of 10 days. Subsequently, dmPFC or vmPFC neuronal activity was modulated during or following presentation of the 5-s nicotine cue, both under extinction and self-administration conditions. We also used in vivo electrophysiology to record the activity of dmPFC neurons during nicotine self-administration and extinction tests. We show that optogenetic inhibition of dmPFC neurons during, but not following, response-contingent presentations of the nicotine cue increased nicotine seeking. We found no effect on nicotine self-administration or on food seeking in an extinction test. We also show that this effect is specific to dmPFC, because optogenetic inhibition of vmPFC had no effect on nicotine seeking and taking. In vivo recordings revealed that dmPFC network neuronal activity was modulated more strongly following nicotine cue presentation in extinction, compared to following nicotine self-administration. Our results strongly suggest that a population of neurons within the dmPFC is involved in encoding the incentive value of nicotine-associated cues.","authors":"Roeland F. Struik; Nathan J.

{"abstract":"This paper explores the views and expectations of patients concerning recontacting in clinical practice. It is based on 41 semi-structured interviews conducted in the United Kingdom. The sample comprised patients or parents of patients: without a diagnosis; recently offered a test for a condition or carrier risk; with a rare condition; with a variant of unknown significance – some of whom had been recontacted. Participants were recruited both via the National Health Service (NHS) and through online, condition-specific support groups. Most respondents viewed recontacting as desirable, however there were different opinions and expectations about what type of new information should trigger recontacting. An awareness of the potential psychological impact of receiving new information led some to suggest that recontacting should be planned, and tailored to the nature of the new information and the specific situation of patients and families. The lack of clarity about lines of responsibility for recontacting and perceptions of resource constraints in the NHS tended to mitigate respondents’ favourable positions towards recontacting and their preferences. Some respondents argued that recontacting could have a preventative value and reduce the cost of healthcare. Others challenged the idea that resources should be used to implement formalised recontacting systems – via arguments that there are ‘more pressing’ public health priorities, and for the need for healthcare services to offer care to new patients.","authors":"Daniele Carrieri; Sandi Dheensa; Shane Doheny; Angus J Clarke; Peter D Turnpenny; Anneke M Lucassen; Susan E Kelly","keywords":"Ethics; Psychology","organization_affiliated":"Egenis, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK; Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK; School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK; School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK; Royal, Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, UK; Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK; Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK; Egenis, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK","title":"Recontacting in clinical practice: the views and expectations of patients in the United Kingdom","id":"5d4a1065-35ef-44d9-87a5-b3b817e12389"}
{"abstract":"The origin and regulation of stem cells sustaining trophoblast renewal in the human placenta remain unclear. Decorin, a leucine-rich proteoglycan restrains trophoblast proliferation, migration/invasiveness and endovascular differentiation, and local decorin overproduction is associated with preeclampsia (PE). Here, we tested the role of decorin in human trophoblast stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, using two models: an immortalized first trimester trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo (HTR) and freshly isolated primary trophoblast (p-trophoblast) from early first trimester (6–9 weeks) placentas. Self-renewal capacity was measured by spheroid forming ability of single cells on ultra-low attachment plates for multiple generations. Markers of embryonic stem (ES) cells, trophoblast stem (TS) cells and trophoblast were used to identify stem cell hierarchy. Differentiation markers for syncytial and extravillous (EVT) pathways were employed to identify differentiated cells. Bewo cells were additionally used to explore DCN effects on syncytialization. Results reveal that the incidence of spheroid forming stem-like cells was 13–15% in HTR and 0.1–0.4%, in early first trimester p-trophoblast, including a stem cell hierarchy of two populations of ES and TS-like cells. DCN restrained ES cell self-renewal, promoted ES to TS transition and maintenance of TS cell stem-ness, but inhibited TS cell differentiation into both syncytial and EVT pathways.","authors":"Pinki Nandi; Hyobin Lim; Eloy Jose Torres-Garcia; Peeyush K.

{"abstract":"Efficient gene deletion methods are essential for the high-throughput study of gene function. Compared to most ascomycete model systems, gene deletion is more laborious in mushroom-forming basidiomycetes due to the relatively low incidence of homologous recombination (HR) and relatively high incidence of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Here, we describe the use of pre-assembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to efficiently delete the homeodomain transcription factor gene hom2 in the mushroom-forming basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune by replacing it with a selectable marker. All components (Cas9 protein, sgRNA, and repair template with selectable marker) were supplied to wild type protoplasts by PEG-mediated transformation, abolishing the need to optimize the expression of cas9 and sgRNAs. A Δku80 background further increased the efficiency of gene deletion. A repair template with homology arms of 250 bp was sufficient to efficiently induce homologous recombination. This is the first report of the use of pre-assembled Cas9 RNPs in a mushroom-forming basidiomycete and this approach may also improve the genetic accessibility of non-model species.","authors":"Peter Jan Vonk; Natalia Escobar; Han A.

{"abstract":"FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation refine prognostic stratification in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. However, data on their role in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (Auto-SCT) as post-remission therapy (PRT) are limited. We therefore sought to retrospectively evaluate the role of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 in a cohort of AML patients (n = 405) with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, autografted in first complete remission (CR1). Patients were transplanted between 2000 and 2014 and reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was the primary outcome. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1WT was the leading molecular subtype (50%), followed by FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut (30%). In the univariate analysis, molecular subtype was associated with LFS, overall survival (OS), and relapse incidence (RI) (p \u003c 0.001); 5-year LFS: FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut 62%, FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1mut 38%, FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1WT 32%, and FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1WT 21%. At 5 years, OS and RI in the FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut subtype were 74% and 35%, respectively. The corresponding OS and RI in other subtypes were below 48% and over 57%. In a Cox multivariable model, molecular subtype was the strongest predictor of LFS, OS, and relapse. In conclusion, AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut experience favorable outcomes when autografted in CR1, suggesting that Auto-SCT is a valid PRT option.","authors":"Roni Shouval; Myriam Labopin; David Bomze; Gabriela M.

{"abstract":"We present deformation patterns in the Lake Urmia Causeway (LUC) in NW Iran based on data collected from four SAR sensors in the form of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series. Sixty-eight images from Envisat (2004–2008), ALOS-1 (2006–2010), TerraSAR-X (2012–2013) and Sentinel-1 (2015–2017) were acquired, and 227 filtered interferograms were generated using the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The rate of line-of-sight (LOS) subsidence of the LUC peaked at 90 mm/year between 2012 and 2013, mainly due to the loss of most of the water in Lake Urmia. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on 200 randomly selected time series of the LUC, and the results are presented in the form of the three major components. The InSAR scores obtained from the PCA were used in a hydro-thermal model to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement along the LUC based on detrended water level and temperature data. The results can be used to establish a geodetic network around the LUC to identify more detailed deformation patterns and to help plan future efforts to reduce the possible costs of damage.","authors":"Sadra Karimzadeh; Masashi Matsuoka; Fumitaka Ogushi","keywords":"Civil engineering; Hydrology; Natural hazards","organization_affiliated":"Department of Architecture and Building Engineering, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of GIS and Remote Sensing, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Architecture and Building Engineering, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Architecture and Building Engineering, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan","title":"Spatiotemporal deformation patterns of the Lake Urmia Causeway as characterized by multisensor InSAR analysis","id":"e2f737e1-5228-40ec-b650-10fcba4f5cfc"}
{"abstract":"Current therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease (AD) remain disappointing and, hence, there is an urgent need for effective treatments. Here, we provide a perspective review on the emerging role of “metabolic inflammation” and stress as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD and propose a novel rationale for correction of metabolic inflammation, increase resilience and potentially slow-down or halt the progression of the neurodegenerative process. Based on recent evidence and observations of an early pilot trial, we posit a potential use of extracorporeal apheresis in the prevention and treatment of AD. Apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein(a), oxidized LDL (low density lipoprotein)'s and large LDL particles, as well as other proinflammatory lipids and stress hormones such as cortisol, have been recognized as key factors in amyloid plaque formation and aggravation of AD. Extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis systems employ well-established, powerful methods to provide an acute, reliable 60–80% reduction in the circulating concentration of these lipid classes and reduce acute cortisol levels. Following a double-membrane extracorporeal apheresis in patients with AD, there was a significant reduction of proinflammatory lipids, circulating cytokines, immune complexes, proinflammatory metals and toxic chaperones in patients with AD. On the basis of the above, we suggest designing clinical trials to assess the promising potential of such “cerebropheresis” treatment in patients with AD and, possibly, other neurodegenerative diseases.","authors":"Stefan R.

{"abstract":"In metazoans, epithelial architecture provides a context that dynamically modulates most if not all epithelial cell responses to intrinsic and extrinsic signals, including growth or survival signalling and transforming oncogene action. Three-dimensional (3D) epithelial culture systems provide tractable models to interrogate the function of human genetic determinants in establishment of context-dependency. We performed an arrayed genetic shRNA screen in mammary epithelial 3D cultures to identify new determinants of epithelial architecture, finding that the key phenotype impacting shRNAs altered not only the data population average but even more noticeably the population distribution. The broad distributions were attributable to sporadic gene silencing actions by shRNA in unselected populations. We employed Maximum Mean Discrepancy concept to capture similar population distribution patterns and demonstrate here the feasibility of the test in identifying an impact of shRNA in populations of 3D structures. Integration of the clustered morphometric data with protein-protein interactions data enabled hypothesis generation of novel biological pathways underlying similar 3D phenotype alterations. The results present a new strategy for 3D phenotype-driven pathway analysis, which is expected to accelerate discovery of context-dependent gene functions in epithelial biology and tumorigenesis.","authors":"Elsa Marques; Tomi Peltola; Samuel Kaski; Juha Klefström","keywords":"Cellular signalling networks; Probabilistic data networks","organization_affiliated":"Cancer Cell Circuitry Laboratory, Research Programs Unit/Translational Cancer Biology \u0026 Medicum, University of Helsinki, P.O Box 63 (street address: Haartmaninkatu 8), 00014 University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland; Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland; Cancer Cell Circuitry Laboratory, Research Programs Unit/Translational Cancer Biology \u0026 Medicum, University of Helsinki, P.O Box 63 (street address: Haartmaninkatu 8), 00014 University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","title":"Phenotype-driven identification of epithelial signalling clusters","id":"c548f604-465f-4203-aeb6-32094f7e04d7"}
{"abstract":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as regulators of fundamental biological processes. Here we report on the characterization of an intergenic lncRNA expressed in epithelial tissues which we termed EPR (Epithelial cell Program Regulator). EPR is rapidly downregulated by TGF-β and its sustained expression largely reshapes the transcriptome, favors the acquisition of epithelial traits, and reduces cell proliferation in cultured mammary gland cells as well as in an animal model of orthotopic transplantation. EPR generates a small peptide that localizes at epithelial cell junctions but the RNA molecule per se accounts for the vast majority of EPR-induced gene expression changes. Mechanistically, EPR interacts with chromatin and regulates Cdkn1a gene expression by affecting both its transcription and mRNA decay through its association with SMAD3 and the mRNA decay-promoting factor KHSRP, respectively. We propose that EPR enables epithelial cells to control proliferation by modulating waves of gene expression in response to TGF-β. Several lncRNAs are regulated by TGF-β. Here the authors report that an intergenic lncRNA —EPR— is a component of the TGF-β signaling pathway and controls epithelial cell proliferation by altering transcription and mRNA decay of Cdkn1a. EPR overexpression restrains tumor growth of orthotopically transplanted mice.","authors":"Martina Rossi; Gabriele Bucci; Dario Rizzotto; Domenico Bordo; Matteo J.

{"abstract":"New diagnostics are needed to improve clinicians’ ability to detect tuberculosis (TB) disease in key populations such as children and persons living with HIV and to rapidly detect drug resistance. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in plasma is a diagnostic target in new obstetric and oncologic applications, but its utility for diagnosing TB is not known. Here we show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA can be detected in plasma of persons with sputum smear-positive TB, even in the absence of mycobacteremia. Among 40 participants with bacteriologically-confirmed smear-positive TB disease who had plasma tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), 18/40 (45%) had a positive result on at least one triplicate reaction. Our results suggest that plasma DNA may be a useful target for improving clinicians’ ability to diagnose TB. We anticipate these findings to be the starting point for optimized methods of TB ccfDNA testing and sequence-based diagnostic applications such as molecular detection of drug resistance.","authors":"E.

{"abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in most organisms. The water flea, Daphnia magna is a key model to study phenotypic, physiological and genomic responses to environmental cues and miRNAs can potentially mediate these responses. By using deep sequencing, genome mapping and manual curations, we have characterised the miRNAome of D. magna. We identified 66 conserved miRNAs and 13 novel miRNAs; all of these were found in the three studied life stages of D. magna (juveniles, subadults, adults), but with variation in expression levels between stages. Forty-one of the miRNAs were clustered into 13 genome clusters also present in the D. pulex genome. Most miRNAs contained sequence variants (isomiRs). The highest expressed isomiRs were 3′ template variants with one nucleotide deletion or 3′ non-template variants with addition of A or U at the 3′ end. We also identified offset RNAs (moRs) and loop RNAs (loRs). Our work extends the base for further work on all species (miRNA, isomiRs, moRNAs, loRNAs) of the miRNAome of Daphnia as biomarkers in response to chemical substances and environment cues, and underline age dependency.","authors":"Dag H.

{"abstract":"To assess a Royston−Parmar flexible parametric survival model to generate a personalised risk profile for keratoconus progression. We re-analysed a historic database of 2723 individuals with keratoconus. A Royston−Parmar survival model was fitted to predict the likelihood of the worse eye progressing to corneal transplantation. We used a backwards selection multivariable fractional polynomial procedure to assist with selection of covariates and identify appropriate transformation(s) to retain in the final model. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from censored survival data using the Kaplan−Meier (KM) method were computed to visually assess how well the model identified eyes likely to progress. In all, 5020 eyes from 2581 patients were available for model development. This included 2378 worst affected eyes, and 313 eyes that progressed to transplantation. The best fitting model [df = 1: Bayes information criterion (BIC) = 1573] included three variables, keratometry [hazard ratio (HR) 0.36: 95% confidence limits (CI) 0.32–0.42], age at baseline [HR 0.97: CI 0.95–0.99] and ethnicity [HR 3.92: CI 2.58–5.95]. Specificity at 1 year was 92.8% (CI 90.4−95.2%) with a corresponding sensitivity of 64.6% (CI 58.9−60.0%). These three prognostic factors account for 41.3% (CI 33.6 – 48.2%) of the variation among the survival curves. Researchers should consider the Royston−Parmar model as an alternative to the Cox model. We illustrate the concepts and our results may lead to better tools that identify individuals at high risk of keratoconus progression.","authors":"Ana Quartilho; Daniel M.

We included 371 older adults (≥60 years) with normal kidney function. Four common diagnostic criteria (the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS), and Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) criteria) were separately applied as the “gold standard”. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (AUC) were applied to evaluate the overall diagnostic accuracy. For identifying low muscle mass, the AUC ranged from 0.505 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.453–0.557) to 0.558 (95% CI 0.506–0.609). For identifying sarcopenia, the AUC ranged from 0.555 (95% CI 0.503–0.606) to 0.618 (95% CI 0.566–0.668). Subgroup analyses according to gender showed similar results.

{"abstract":"Aims To compare the anaesthetic efficacy of articaine, lidocaine and mepivacaine for buccal infiltration (BI) following lidocaine inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) in mandibular posterior teeth with irreversible pulpitis. Materials and methods Patients with irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth and unsuccessful IANB were randomly assigned to three groups: articaine group (n = 52), lidocaine group (n = 52) and mepivacaine group (n = 52). They were instructed to rate the pain experienced at four phases (before the injection, after IANB, after BI and during endodontic access) on a Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (VAS). Success was defined as the ability to access and instrument the tooth with no pain or mild pain (VAS rating ≤54 mm) after BI. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that articaine was associated with a higher success rate compared with lidocaine (OR = 3.89, 95% CI: 1.35-11.27; P = 0.02) and mepivacaine (OR = 3.67, 95% CI: 1.24-9.75; P = 0.01), after controlling for age, gender and initial pain.

{"abstract":"Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), the most common childhood brain tumor, is a low-grade glioma with a single driver BRAF rearrangement. Here, we perform scRNAseq in six PAs using methods that enabled detection of the rearrangement. When compared to higher-grade gliomas, a strikingly higher proportion of the PA cancer cells exhibit a differentiated, astrocyte-like phenotype. A smaller proportion of cells exhibit a progenitor-like phenotype with evidence of proliferation. These express a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) programme that was absent from higher-grade gliomas. Immune cells, especially microglia, comprise 40% of all cells in the PAs and account for differences in bulk expression profiles between tumor locations and subtypes. These data indicate that MAPK signaling is restricted to relatively undifferentiated cancer cells in PA, with implications for investigational therapies directed at this pathway. Pilocytic astrocytoma is a low-grade pediatric glioma, characterized by a single BRAF rearrangement.

{"abstract":"To be effective and secure participation, a global climate change agreement needs to be perceived as fair by the countries involved in it. The Paris Agreement approached differentiation of countries’ responsibilities to address climate change by departing from the rigid distinction between industrialised and developing countries through the inclusion of ‘subtle differentiation’ of specific subsets of countries (e.g., Least Developed Countries) for certain substantive issues (e.g., climate finance) and/or for specific procedures (e.g., timelines and reporting). In this article, we analyse whether the self-differentiation countries followed when formulating their own climate plans, or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), is consistent with the Paris Agreement’s subtle differentiation. We find that there is consistency for mitigation and adaptation, but not for support (climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building). As NDCs are the main instrument for achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals, this inconsistency needs to be addressed to allow subsequent rounds of NDCs to be more ambitious.","authors":"Pieter Pauw; Kennedy Mbeva; Harro van Asselt","keywords":"Development studies; Environmental studies; Geography; Politics and international relations","organization_affiliated":"Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Stockholm Environment Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; German Development Institute, Bonn, Germany; University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; African Centre for Technology Studies, Nairobi, Kenya; Stockholm Environment Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland","title":"Subtle differentiation of countries’ responsibilities under the Paris Agreement","id":"1b98c303-7801-4d93-9b66-5ce5222fc09d"}
{"abstract":"Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, with metastatic melanoma being refractory to currently available conventional therapies. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of coronatine (COR) on the proliferation of metastatic melanoma cells. COR inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells but negligibly affected the proliferation of normal melanocytes. Comparative metabolic and lipidomic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct infusion-mass spectrometry was performed to investigate COR-induced metabolic changes. These analyses identified 33 metabolites and 82 lipids. Of these, the levels of lactic acid and glutamic acid, which are involved in energy metabolism, significantly decreased in COR-treated melanoma cells. Lipidomic profiling indicated that ceramide levels increased in COR-treated melanoma cells, suggesting that ceramides could function as a suppressor of cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI) species, including PI 16:0/18:0, 16:0/18:1, 18:0/18:0, and 18:0/18:1, which were found to be potential biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in our previous study, were lower in the COR-treated cells than in control cells. The findings of metabolomic and lipidomic profiling performed in the present study provide new insights on the anticancer mechanisms of COR and can be used to apply COR in cancer treatment.","authors":"Hye-Youn Kim; Hanyong Jin; Jeehyeon Bae; Hyung-Kyoon Choi","keywords":"Mass spectrometry; Melanoma","organization_affiliated":"College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"Metabolic and lipidomic investigation of the antiproliferative effects of coronatine against human melanoma cells","id":"0349e16b-b2e1-43c3-8ac0-5ab61352c325"}

{"abstract":"Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) are recognised as global extinction drivers of threatened species. Unfortunately, biodiversity managers have few tested solutions to manage them when often the desperate need for solutions necessitates a response. Here we test in situ biosecurity protocols to assess the efficacy of managing Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), one of the most common and emergent viral diseases in wild parrots (Psittaciformes) that is currently affecting numerous threatened species globally. In response to an outbreak of PBFD in Mauritius “echo” parakeets (Psittacula eques), managers implemented a set of biosecurity protocols to limit transmission and impact of Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). Here we used a reciprocal design experiment on the wild population to test whether BFDV management reduced viral prevalence and viral load, and improved nestling body condition and fledge success. Whilst management reduced the probability of nestling infection by approximately 11% there was no observed impact on BFDV load and nestling body condition. In contrast to expectations there was lower fledge success in nests with added BFDV biosecurity (83% in untreated vs. 79% in treated nests). Our results clearly illustrate that management for wildlife conservation should be critically evaluated through targeted monitoring and experimental manipulation, and this evaluation should always focus on the fundamental objective of conservation.","authors":"Deborah J.

{"abstract":"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a complex and multi-factorial disease, and low-grade inflammation is associated with pathogenesis of nAMD. Aqueous humor could reflect intraocular immune environments in various eye diseases. The research so far used aqueous humor samples and revealed that inflammation is involved in pathophysiology of nAMD, although immunological roles of cytokines were evaluated inadequately with aspect to individual effects. Here we used 27 kinds of cytokines covering general immunologic reactions, examined specific expression patterns of cytokines, and assessed relationships between inflammation and pathophysiology of nAMD by multivariate analyses. In nAMD eyes, principal component analysis showed that IL-7, MCP-1, MIP-1β and VEGF had high principal component loadings of over 0.6 in the first principal component constituting 32.6% of all variability of the data. In exploratory factor analysis, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1β had high factor loadings (FL) of over 0.5 in Factor 1 constituting 32.6% of all variability, while VEGF had FL of over 1.0 in Factor 3 constituting 10.7% of all variability. In hierarchical cluster analysis, MCP-1 and VEGF were located in the cluster of first proximate mutual distance to central retinal thickness. These data could suggest that low-grade inflammation is a principal contributor in nAMD.","authors":"Tomohito Sato; Masaru Takeuchi; Yoko Karasawa; Kei Takayama; Toshio Enoki","keywords":"Chemokines; Inflammatory diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ophthalmology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; Department of Ophthalmology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; Enoki Eye Clinic, Sayama, Saitama, Japan","title":"Comprehensive expression patterns of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous humor of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration","id":"c2dd48af-bedc-4300-aac4-a7297ed2e40b"}
{"abstract":"Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer.","authors":"Eun Hye Lee; Eun Young Kim; Sang Hoon Lee; Yun Ho Roh; Ah Young Leem; Joo Han Song; Song Yee Kim; Kyung Soo Chung; Ji Ye Jung; Young Ae Kang; Young Sam Kim; Joon Chang; Moo Suk Park","keywords":"Fungal infection; Lung cancer","organization_affiliated":"Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Biostatistics Collaboration Unit, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Chest Diseases, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea","title":"Risk factors and clinical characteristics of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in lung cancer","id":"3ee38024-e951-4c62-ae98-c906456f89d4"}
{"abstract":"The authors provide evidence that a cerebellum-like structure at the initial stage of mammalian auditory processing (the dorsal cochlear nucleus) functions to cancel out self-generated sounds. A similar function has been established for cerebellum-like structures in electroreceptive fish, suggesting a conserved function for these structures across vertebrates. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) integrates auditory nerve input with a diverse array of sensory and motor signals processed in circuitry similar to that of the cerebellum. Yet how the DCN contributes to early auditory processing has been a longstanding puzzle. Using electrophysiological recordings in mice during licking behavior, we show that DCN neurons are largely unaffected by self-generated sounds while remaining sensitive to external acoustic stimuli. Recordings in deafened mice, together with neural activity manipulations, indicate that self-generated sounds are cancelled by non-auditory signals conveyed by mossy fibers. In addition, DCN neurons exhibit gradual reductions in their responses to acoustic stimuli that are temporally correlated with licking. Together, these findings suggest that DCN may act as an adaptive filter for cancelling self-generated sounds. Adaptive filtering has been established previously for cerebellum-like sensory structures in fish, suggesting a conserved function for such structures across vertebrates.","authors":"Shobhit Singla; Conor Dempsey; Richard Warren; Armen G Enikolopov; Nathaniel B Sawtell","keywords":"Auditory system; Neural circuits","organization_affiliated":"Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA; Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA; Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA; Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, USA; Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA","title":"A cerebellum-like circuit in the auditory system cancels responses to self-generated sounds","id":"f3d11ec8-6594-4a3e-be62-7643a11a982f"}
{"abstract":"Soil testing is an important diagnostic tool for assessing crop-available soil potassium (K) and hence making appropriate fertilizer recommendation. This study was aimed at correlating grain yield response data to soil-test K extracted with ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), cold nitric acid (HNO3), sodium tetraphenylboron (NaTPB) and boiling HNO3 solution, based on 54 field trials conducted during 2011 to 2015 across 15 counties in Hubei province, China. The specific objectives were to establish abundance and deficiency indices of available soil-K (ASK) for rice (Oryza sativa L.) and make accurate K fertilizer recommendations. Potassium extracted with NaTPB and boiling HNO3 was 1.47 times and 3.61 times higher respectively than that extracted with cold HNO3, while K extracted with cold HNO3 was 1.32 times higher than that extracted with NH4OAc. There were significant logarithmic relationships between crop response and soil-test K. The R2 values for cold HNO3-K and NaTPB-K methods were much higher than for NH4OAc-K method. In order to calibrate the application, the abundance and deficiency indices of ASK categorized by cold HNO3-K in low, medium, high and very high ranges were \u003c50 mg kg−1, 50 to 100 mg kg−1, 100 to 200 mg kg−1 and \u003e200 mg kg−1 respectively, and that defined by NaTPB-K were \u003c60 mg kg−1, 60 to 150 mg kg−1, 150 to 330 mg kg−1 and \u003e330 mg kg−1, respectively.

{"abstract":"Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) not treated with L-Carnitine can lead to sudden cardiac death. To our knowledge, it is unknown if asymptomatic patients treated with L-Carnitine suffer from myocardial scarring and thus be at greater risk of potentially serious arrhythmia. Cardiac evaluation of function and myocardial scarring is non-invasively best supported by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The study included 36 PCD patients, 17 carriers and 17 healthy subjects. A CMR cine stack in the short-axis plane were acquired to evaluate left ventricle (LV) systolic and diastolic function and a similar LGE stack to evaluate myocardial scarring and replacement fibrosis. LV volumes and ejection fraction were not different between PCD patients, carriers and healthy subjects. However, LV mass was higher in PCD patients with the severe homozygous mutation, c.95 A \u003e G (p = 0.037; n = 17). Among homozygous PCD patients there were two cases of unexplained myocardial scarring and this is in contrast to no myocardial scarring in any of the other study participants (p = 0.10). LV mass was increased in PCD patients. L-carnitine supplementation is essential in order to prevent potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia and serious adverse cardiac remodeling.","authors":"Kasper Kyhl; Tóra Róin; Allan Lund; Niels Vejlstrup; Per Lav Madsen; Thomas Engstrøm; Jan Rasmussen","keywords":"Cardiovascular biology; Medical research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Medicine, The National Hospital, Tórshavn, Faroe Islands; The Cardiac MRI Groups, Departments of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Medicine, The National Hospital, Tórshavn, Faroe Islands; Centre for Inherited Metabolic Diseases, Departments of Paediatrics and Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; The Cardiac MRI Groups, Departments of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev-Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Medicine, The National Hospital, Tórshavn, Faroe Islands; Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark","title":"Cardiac function and incidence of unexplained myocardial scarring in patients with primary carnitine deficiency - a cardiac magnetic resonance study","id":"c11fb5cd-a1a9-4e0a-85ab-76a70da5f67e"}
{"abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the leading causes of end stage renal disease. Despite recent therapies, mortality due to DKD and resources spent on healthcare are important problems. Thus, appropriate markers are needed to predict renal outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the role of peripheral perfusion as an indicator for renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This retrospective cohort study included 566 patients who were admitted to Matsushita Memorial Hospital in Osaka, Japan for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Peripheral perfusion was assessed using perfusion index (PI), which represents the level of circulation through peripheral tissues and was measured on each toe using a Masimo SET Radical-7 (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) instrument. The duration of follow up was 3.0 years. The median age of patients was 70 years (IQR range: 61–77 years) and median PI value was 2.9% (IQR range: 1.8–4.8%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that PI (per 1% increase) was associated with an odds ratio of composite of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and/or doubling of serum creatinine level; n = 40 (odds ratio 0.823 [95% CI: 0.680–0.970]), and composite of ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine level, and renal death and/or cardiovascular death; n = 44 (odds ratio 0.803 [95% CI: 0.665–0.944]). The factors which were statistically significant in univariate analysis and those known to be related factors for renal event were considered simultaneously as independent variables for multiple logistic regression analysis.

{"abstract":"Tuberaceae is one of the most diverse lineages of symbiotic truffle-forming fungi. To understand the molecular underpinning of the ectomycorrhizal truffle lifestyle, we compared the genomes of Piedmont white truffle (Tuber magnatum), Périgord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum), Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum), pig truffle (Choiromyces venosus) and desert truffle (Terfezia boudieri) to saprotrophic Pezizomycetes. Reconstructed gene duplication/loss histories along a time-calibrated phylogeny of Ascomycetes revealed that Tuberaceae-specific traits may be related to a higher gene diversification rate. Genomic features in Tuber species appear to be very similar, with high transposon content, few genes coding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, a substantial set of lineage-specific fruiting-body-upregulated genes and high expression of genes involved in volatile organic compound metabolism. Developmental and metabolic pathways expressed in ectomycorrhizae and fruiting bodies of T. magnatum and T. melanosporum are unexpectedly very similar, owing to the fact that they diverged ~100 Ma. Volatile organic compounds from pungent truffle odours are not the products of Tuber-specific gene innovations, but rely on the differential expression of an existing gene repertoire. These genomic resources will help to address fundamental questions in the evolution of the truffle lifestyle and the ecology of fungi that have been praised as food delicacies for centuries. Genomes of three Tuberaceae species and two related truffle species reveal genetic similarities across symbiotic truffle-forming fungi, including high expression of genes involved in volatile organic compound metabolism.","authors":"Claude Murat; Thibaut Payen; Benjamin Noel; Alan Kuo; Emmanuelle Morin; Juan Chen; Annegret Kohler; Krisztina Krizsán; Raffaella Balestrini; Corinne Da Silva; Barbara Montanini; Mathieu Hainaut; Elisabetta Levati; Kerrie W.

{"abstract":" Recommendations based on high-level evidence for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up monitoring of upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUCs) are lacking and decision-making is often based on data from lower tract urothelial carcinoma. Here, Baard et al. review diagnostic tests for UTUC, describe efforts to improve lesion visualization, and propose an algorithm that integrates diagnosis, treatment, and clinical risk-stratification. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare condition and recommendations based on a high level of evidence for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up monitoring are lacking. Current decision-making is often based on evidence from trials investigating urothelial carcinoma of the lower tract. Radical nephroureterectomy has been the standard of care for UTUC but kidney-sparing treatment using endoscopic approaches has been established for a select patient group with low-grade and low-stage disease. Optimal treatment choice requires correct tumour characterization. According to available recommendations, diagnostic work-up of UTUC includes evaluation by CT urography or MRI urography, cystoscopy and urine cytology. Ureterorenoscopy and lesion biopsy are grade C recommendations in patients with suspected UTUC. When kidney-sparing treatment is planned, ureterorenoscopy and biopsy should be considered and are the procedures of choice in most cases. These diagnostics have limitations and their accuracy varies in defining tumour characteristics and predicting grade and stage. Urinary tests have higher sensitivity than cytology for detection of lower tract urothelial carcinoma but evidence of their benefit in UTUCs is lacking. New optical and image enhancement techniques are being developed to facilitate real-time diagnostics with increased accuracy. A new diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected UTUC that integrates the diagnosis, treatment and clinical risk stratification is required.","authors":"Joyce Baard; Daniel M. de Bruin; Patricia J.

{"abstract":"The early and accurate diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be challenging. Fibrinogen plays an important role in mediating inflammation of bacterial infections and therefore could be a valuable biomarker for PJI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of serum levels of fibrinogen in detecting PJI, and to compare the results with the established PJI biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count. Eighty-four patients (124 surgeries) were prospectively included. The preoperatively analyzed parameters were fibrinogen, CRP and leukocyte count. The sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers were calculated and compared. Fibrinogen (p \u003c 0.001), CRP (p \u003c 0.001) and leukocyte count (p \u003c 0.001) had a statistically significant correlation with the criteria defining the presence of PJI. For fibrinogen, the value of 519 mg/dl had a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.34. The CRP cut-off point of 11.00 mg/dl had a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.74. The leukocyte count of 5.68 G/l had a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.39. Our results indicated that fibrinogen is a significant biomarker for detecting a bacterial PJI. It has shown to be a cost-efficient diagnostic support with high sensitivity and specificity.","authors":"S. M. Klim; F. Amerstorfer; G. Gruber; G. A. Bernhardt; R. Radl; L. Leitner; A. Leithner; M.

{"abstract":"Synthetic spike-in standards (‘sequins’), representing spliced mRNA isoforms, provide internal controls for assessing transcript assembly and quantification within and between RNA sequencing libraries. Sequins representing fused genes can be used to determine the sensitivity limit for oncogenic fusions in cancer samples. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to assemble spliced isoforms, quantify expressed genes and provide a global profile of the transcriptome. However, the size and diversity of the transcriptome, the wide dynamic range in gene expression and inherent technical biases confound RNA-seq analysis. We have developed a set of spike-in RNA standards, termed 'sequins' (sequencing spike-ins), that represent full-length spliced mRNA isoforms. Sequins have an entirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes, but they align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The combination of multiple sequins across a range of concentrations emulates alternative splicing and differential gene expression, and it provides scaling factors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of sequins in RNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of reliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA samples. In addition, we have designed a complementary set of sequins that represent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to aid in cancer diagnosis. RNA sequins provide a qualitative and quantitative reference with which to navigate the complexity of the human transcriptome.","authors":"Simon A Hardwick; Wendy Y Chen; Ted Wong; Ira W Deveson; James Blackburn; Stacey B Andersen; Lars K Nielsen; John S Mattick; Tim R Mercer","keywords":"RNA sequencing; RNA splicing; Transcriptomics","organization_affiliated":"Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia","title":"Spliced synthetic genes as internal controls in RNA sequencing experiments","id":"a4d73ef3-23e3-41af-ba57-6e4112311b5b"}

The DLTS signal and concentration of the electronic deep levels are independent of the filling pulse width, and the depth toward the bottom of the sample, evidenced by the fact that they are correlated to noninteracting point defects. Furthermore, Photoluminescence (PL) measurement shows green luminescence, suggesting that unidentified point defects or complex, which affect the optical characterisitics, exhibit. Despite the Si-based materials, the freestanding GaN exhibits deep level characteristics comparable to those of conventional freestanding GaN, suggesting that it is a desirable material for use in the next generation optoelectronic devices with the large-scalibilityand low production costs.","authors":"Moonsang Lee; Chang Wan Ahn; Thi Kim Oanh Vu; Hyun Uk Lee; Eun Kyu Kim; Sungsoo Park","keywords":"Characterization and analytical techniques; Electrical and electronic engineering; Inorganic LEDs; Spectrophotometry","organization_affiliated":"Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Physics, Quantum-Function Research Laboratory, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Physics, Quantum-Function Research Laboratory, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Advanced Nano-surface Research Group, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Physics, Quantum-Function Research Laboratory, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Science Education, Jeonju University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea; Analytical Laboratory of Advanced Ferroelectric Crystals, Jeonju University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea","title":"First observation of electronic trap levels in freestanding GaN crystals extracted from Si substrates by hydride vapour phase epitaxy","id":"49e9e579-bdf2-45bc-804c-41e0a20bf677"}
{"abstract":"The study of pharmacological interactions between herbal remedies and conventional drugs is important because consuming traditional herbal remedies as supplements or alternative medicine is fairly common and their concomitant administration with prescribed drugs could either have a favorable or unfavorable effect. Therefore, this work aims to determine the pharmacological interactions of a turmeric acetone extract (TAE) and its main metabolite (curcumin) with common anti-ulcer drugs (ranitidine and bismuth subsalicylate), using an ethanol-induced ulcer model in Wistar rats. The analysis of the interactions was carried out via the Combination Index-Isobologram Equation method. The combination index (CI) calculated at 0.5 of the affected fraction (fa) indicated that the TAE or curcumin in combination with ranitidine had a subadditive interaction. The results suggest that this antagonistic mechanism is associated to the mucoadhesion of curcumin and the TAE, determined by rheological measurements. Contrastingly, both the TAE and curcumin combined with bismuth subsalicylate had an additive relationship, which means that there is no pharmacological interaction. This agrees with the normalized isobolograms obtained for each combination. The results of this study suggest that mucoadhesion of curcumin and the TAE could interfere in the effectiveness of ranitidine, and even other drugs.","authors":"Alejandra Orona-Ortiz; Luis Medina-Torres; Josué A.

{"abstract":"The hydroxyl (OH) radical is the key oxidant in the global atmosphere as it controls the concentrations of toxic gases like carbon monoxide and climate relevant gases like methane. In some regions, oxidation by chlorine (Cl) radical is also important, and in the stratosphere both OH and Cl radicals impact ozone. An empirical method is presented to determine effective OH concentrations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, based on CH4, CH3Cl, and SF6 data from aircraft measurements (IAGOS-CARIBIC) and a ground-based station (NOAA). Tropospheric OH average values of 10.9 × 105 (σ = 9.6 × 105) molecules cm−3 and stratospheric OH average values of 1.1 × 105 (σ = 0.8 × 105) molecules cm−3 were derived over mean ages derived from SF6. Using CH4 led to higher OH estimates due to the temperature dependence of the CH4 + OH reaction in the troposphere and due to the presence of Cl in the stratosphere. Exploiting the difference in effective OH calculated from CH3Cl and CH4 we determine the main altitude for tropospheric CH4 oxidation to be 4.5 ~ 10.5 km and the average Cl radical concentration in the lower stratosphere to be 1.1 × 104 (σ = 0.6 × 104) molecules cm−3 (with a 35% measurement uncertainty). Furthermore, the data are used to examine the temporal trend in annual average stratospheric OH and Cl radical concentrations between 2010 and 2015. The year 2013 showed highest stratospheric OH and lowest Cl but no clear temporal trend was observed in the data in this period. These data serve as a baseline for future studies of stratospheric circulation changes. A method to ascertain the effective concentration of OH in certain regions of the atmosphere by measuring ‘‘proxy’’ species has been developed. Knowing how much of the radical OH is present in the atmosphere is important because of its role in breaking down polluting gases such as CO, NOx and volatile organic compounds. Now, a team led by Jonathan Williams at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, in Mainz, Germany, has shown how long-term aircraft and ground-based measurements of CH4, CH3Cl and SF6 can be used to determine the effective concentration of OH in the troposphere and the stratosphere. The method is used to estimate the OH concentration over the time period 2008–2015 and—as long as the same ‘‘proxy’’ gases are measured—will allow the impact of future atmospheric events to be assessed.","authors":"Mengze Li; Einar Karu; Carl Brenninkmeijer; Horst Fischer; Jos Lelieveld; Jonathan Williams","keywords":"Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric dynamics","organization_affiliated":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany","title":"Tropospheric OH and stratospheric OH and Cl concentrations determined from CH 4 , CH 3 Cl, and SF 6 measurements","id":"be369204-2518-4887-8618-41a94248caef"}
{"abstract":"Chemoresistance has become a major obstacle to the success of cancer therapy, but the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are not yet fully understood. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification that is regulated by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and has an important role in a wide range of cellular functions. Here we assessed the role of O-GlcNAcylation in chemoresistance and investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms. The results showed that the HBP has an important role in cancer cell chemoresistance by regulating O-GlcNAcylation. An increase in the levels of O-GlcNAcylation indicates an increased resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Acute treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) or camptothecin (CPT) induced O-GlcNAcylation through HBP activation. In fact, the chemotherapy agents activated the AKT/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) axis and then induced the HBP. Furthermore, the observed elevation of cellular O-GlcNAcylation led to activation of survival signalling pathways and chemoresistance in cancer cells. Finally, suppression of O-GlcNAcylation reduced the resistance of both established and primary cancer cells to chemotherapy. These results provide significant novel insights regarding the important role of the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation in regulating cancer chemoresistance. Thus, O-GlcNAc inhibition might offer a new strategy for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy.","authors":"Yubo Liu; Yu Cao; Xiaoqing Pan; Meiyun Shi; Qiong Wu; Tianmiao Huang; Hui Jiang; Wenli Li; Jianing Zhang","keywords":"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","organization_affiliated":"School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China","title":"O-GlcNAc elevation through activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway enhances cancer cell chemoresistance","id":"68912db8-df7c-4465-bef2-7e65789c4013"}

Although many cellular behaviours are influenced by intracellular mechanical forces3–6 that also alter the material properties of the cell, the precise mechanistic relationship between intracellular forces and cell stiffness remains unclear. Here we develop a cell mechanical imaging platform with high spatial resolution that reveals the existence of nanoscale stiffness patterns governed by intracellular forces. On the basis of these findings, we develop and validate a cellular mechanical model that quantitatively relates cell stiffness to intracellular forces. This allows us to determine the magnitude of tension within actin bundles, cell cortex and plasma membrane from the cell stiffness patterns across individual cells. These results expand our knowledge on the mechanical interaction between cells and their environments, and offer an alternative approach to determine physiologically relevant intracellular forces from high-resolution cell stiffness images. High-spatial-resolution mechanical imaging reveals that intracellular forces generate cellular nanoscale stiffness patterns.","authors":"Nicola Mandriota; Claudia Friedsam; John A.

{"abstract":"The development of drugs that can inactivate disease-causing cells (e.g. cancer cells or parasites) without causing collateral damage to healthy or to host cells is complicated by the fact that many proteins are very similar between organisms. Nevertheless, due to subtle, quantitative differences between the biochemical reaction networks of target cell and host, a drug can limit the flux of the same essential process in one organism more than in another. We identified precise criteria for this ‘network-based’ drug selectivity, which can serve as an alternative or additive to structural differences. We combined computational and experimental approaches to compare energy metabolism in the causative agent of sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei, with that of human erythrocytes, and identified glucose transport and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the most selective antiparasitic targets. Computational predictions were validated experimentally in a novel parasite-erythrocytes co-culture system.

Although structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia occur in both ASD and ADHD, no structural studies have focused exclusively on patients with comorbid ASD and ADHD. We thus aimed to clarify the structural features and developmental changes in patients with comorbid ASD and ADHD in a relatively large sample from two sites. Ninety-two patients were age-matched to 141 typically developing (TD) controls (age range: 5–16 years) and assessed for volumetric characteristics using structural magnetic resonance imaging (i.e. surface-based morphometry). While there were no significant differences in prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia volumes, patients with ASD and ADHD exhibited significantly lower left postcentral gyrus volumes than TD controls. We observed significantly lower postcentral gyrus volumes exclusively in children and preadolescents, and not in adolescents. Our findings suggest that abnormal somatosensory, attributed to delayed maturation of the left postcentral gyrus, leads to the core symptoms experienced by patients with comorbid ASD and ADHD.","authors":"Yoshifumi Mizuno; Kuriko Kagitani-Shimono; Minyoung Jung; Kai Makita; Shinichiro Takiguchi; Takashi X.

{"abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and biological processes through binding to messenger RNAs. Predicting the relationship between miRNAs and their targets is crucial for research and clinical applications. Many tools have been developed to predict miRNA–target interactions, but variable results among the different prediction tools have caused confusion for users. To solve this problem, we developed miRgo, an application that integrates many of these tools. To train the prediction model, extreme values and median values from four different data combinations, which were obtained via an energy distribution function, were used to find the most representative dataset. Support vector machines were used to integrate 11 prediction tools, and numerous feature types used in these tools were classified into six categories—binding energy, scoring function, evolution evidence, binding type, sequence property, and structure—to simplify feature selection. In addition, a novel evaluation indicator, the Chu-Hsieh-Liang (CHL) index, was developed to improve the prediction power in positive data for feature selection. miRgo achieved better results than all other prediction tools in evaluation by an independent testing set and by its subset of functionally important genes.

{"abstract":"A comprehensive screening method using machine learning and many factors (biological characteristics, Helicobacter pylori infection status, endoscopic findings and blood test results), accumulated daily as data in hospitals, could improve the accuracy of screening to classify patients at high or low risk of developing gastric cancer. We used XGBoost, a classification method known for achieving numerous winning solutions in data analysis competitions, to capture nonlinear relations among many input variables and outcomes using the boosting approach to machine learning. Longitudinal and comprehensive medical check-up data were collected from 25,942 participants who underwent multiple endoscopies from 2006 to 2017 at a single facility in Japan. The participants were classified into a case group (y = 1) or a control group (y = 0) if gastric cancer was or was not detected, respectively, during a 122-month period. Among 1,431 total participants (89 cases and 1,342 controls), 1,144 (80%) were randomly selected for use in training 10 classification models; the remaining 287 (20%) were used to evaluate the models. The results showed that XGBoost outperformed logistic regression and showed the highest area under the curve value (0.899). Accumulating more data in the facility and performing further analyses including other input variables may help expand the clinical utility.","authors":"Junichi Taninaga; Yu Nishiyama; Kazutoshi Fujibayashi; Toshiaki Gunji; Noriko Sasabe; Kimiko Iijima; Toshio Naito","keywords":"Cancer; Gastrointestinal cancer","organization_affiliated":"Faculty of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan; Faculty of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan; Department of General Medicine, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan; Medical Technology Innovation Center, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan; Clinical Research and Trial Center, Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Preventive Medicine, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Preventive Medicine, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Preventive Medicine, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of General Medicine, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan","title":"Prediction of future gastric cancer risk using a machine learning algorithm and comprehensive medical check-up data: A case-control study","id":"77e47a23-2dd6-4118-9ec2-1c17e3986e98"}

{"abstract":"Intravitreal injections of antibody-based biologics targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are highly effective and have markedly decreased the risk of visual impairment associated with prevalent retinal diseases, such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetes macular oedema. The diseases are chronic in their nature, and most patients need long-term therapy to suppress disease activity. We previously reported a compounding method for repackaging and storage of aflibercept (Eylea), a commonly used anti-VEGF biologic, in silicone oil-coated plastic syringes without compromising drug stability or activity. In addition to improving safety and time spent per patient, compounding of anti-VEGF biologics enables single-dose vials to be split into multiple syringes, thereby considerably reducing waste and drug expenses. However, symptomatic silicone oil droplets may deposit in the eye’s vitreous body after repetitive injections. To fully avoid this complication, we here report on a novel pharmaceutical compounding method using silicone oil-free syringes and a 33 G × 9 mm Low Dead Space Needle hub injection needle. We evaluate the method for three anti-VEGF biologics commonly used in ophthalmology: aflibercept, ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin). Our results show that compounding and storage for one week does not compromise the functional activity of the biologics and allows for safe and cost-effective compounding of anti-VEGF biologics for intravitreal injections in prefilled silicone oil-free syringes.","authors":"Heidrun Elisabeth Lode; Torleif Tollefsrud Gjølberg; Stian Foss; Magne Sand Sivertsen; Jørgen Brustugun; Yvonne Andersson; Øystein Kalsnes Jørstad; Morten Carstens Moe; Jan Terje Andersen","keywords":"Proteins; Therapeutics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine and Department of Pharmacology, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine and Department of Pharmacology, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine and Department of Pharmacology, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Hospital Pharmacies Enterprise, South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Oslo, Norway; Hospital Pharmacies Enterprise, South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Oslo, Norway; Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine and Department of Pharmacology, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway","title":"A new method for pharmaceutical compounding and storage of anti-VEGF biologics for intravitreal use in silicone oil-free prefilled plastic syringes","id":"0bb425ce-5798-42be-a797-921b9a141f6f"}
{"abstract":"The distribution of the transcription machinery among different sub-nuclear domains raises the question on how the architecture of the nucleus modulates the transcriptional response. Here, we used fluorescence fluctuation analyses to quantitatively explore the organization of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the interphase nucleus of living cells. We found that this ligand-activated transcription factor diffuses within the nucleus and dynamically interacts with bodies enriched in the coregulator NCoA-2, DNA-dependent foci and chromatin targets. The distribution of the receptor among the nuclear compartments depends on NCoA-2 and the conformation of the receptor as assessed with synthetic ligands and GR mutants with impaired transcriptional abilities. Our results suggest that the partition of the receptor in different nuclear reservoirs ultimately regulates the concentration of receptor available for the interaction with specific targets, and thus has an impact on transcription regulation.","authors":"Martin Stortz; Diego M.

In this report, sedimentation velocity centrifugation, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and molecular modelling were used to identify the small oligomeric species formed by the 42 amino acid residue long isoform of Aβ (Aβ42) in solution, characterized by a sedimentation coefficient of 2.56 S, and a radius of gyration between 2 and 4 nm. The measured sedimentation coefficient is in close agreement with the sedimentation coefficient calculated for Aβ42 hexamers using MD simulations at µM concentration. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report detailing the Aβ42 oligomeric species by SANS measurements. Our results demonstrate that the smallest detectable species in solution are penta- to hexamers.

{"abstract":"It is well known that the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota can influence the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of cancer therapies. Conversely, the effect of cancer treatments on the composition of the GI microbiota is poorly understood. We hypothesized that oral androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ATT), including bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, may be associated with compositional differences in the GI microbiota. We profiled the fecal microbiota in a cross-sectional study of 30 patients that included healthy male volunteers and men with different clinical states of prostate cancer (i.e., localized, biochemically recurrent, and metastatic disease) using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Functional inference of identified taxa was performed using PICRUSt. We report a significant difference in alpha diversity in GI microbiota among men with versus without a prostate cancer diagnosis. Further analysis identified significant compositional differences in the GI microbiota of men taking ATT, including a greater abundance of species previously linked to response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae spp. In functional analyses, we found an enriched representation of bacterial gene pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis in the fecal microbiota of men taking oral ATT. There are measurable differences in the GI microbiota of men receiving oral ATT. We speculate that oral hormonal therapies for prostate cancer may alter the GI microbiota, influence clinical responses to ATT, and/or potentially modulate the antitumor effects of future therapies including immunotherapy. Given our findings, larger, longitudinal studies are warranted.","authors":"Karen S. Sfanos; Mark C. Markowski; Lauren B. Peiffer; Sarah E. Ernst; James R. White; Kenneth J. Pienta; Emmanuel S.

The anti-melanoma activity and potential mechanisms of biodegradable αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles were investigated.

In the research of mechanisms, the αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell, induced apoptosis via both apoptosis pathways of intrinsic and exogenous in vitro, as well as suppressed tumor growth and restrained angiogenesis in vivo, which implied that the αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles have potential application as a novel chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma therapy.","authors":"Shuping Yang; Xiang Gao; Yihong He; Yuzhu Hu; Bocheng Xu; Zhiqiang Cheng; Mingli Xiang; Yongmei Xie","keywords":"Drug development; Skin cancer","organization_affiliated":"Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China; Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Lab of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, PR China","title":"Applying an innovative biodegradable self-assembly nanomicelles to deliver α-mangostin for improving anti-melanoma activity","id":"f6e78710-87aa-4f9d-9cf9-77c80b7a4de4"}
{"abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are widely studied regarding their role in cell-to-cell communication and disease, as well as for applications as biomarkers or drug delivery vehicles. EVs contain membrane and intraluminal proteins, affecting their structure and thereby likely their functioning. Here, we use atomic force microscopy for mechanical characterization of erythrocyte, or red blood cell (RBC), EVs from healthy individuals and from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) due to ankyrin deficiency. While these EVs are packed with proteins, their response to indentation resembles that of fluid liposomes lacking proteins. The bending modulus of RBC EVs of healthy donors is ~15 kbT, similar to the RBC membrane. Surprisingly, whereas RBCs become more rigid in HS, patient EVs have a significantly (~40%) lower bending modulus than donor EVs. These results shed light on the mechanism and effects of EV budding and might explain the reported increase in vesiculation of RBCs in HS patients. Red blood cell disorders are often accompanied by increased release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), but their structural and mechanical properties are not fully understood. Here, the authors show that red blood cell EVs show liposome-like mechanical features and are softened in blood disorder patients.","authors":"Daan Vorselen; Susan M. van Dommelen; Raya Sorkin; Melissa C.

{"abstract":"The mid-latitude westerly winds of the Southern Hemisphere play a central role in the global climate system via Southern Ocean upwelling1, carbon exchange with the deep ocean2, Agulhas leakage (transport of Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic)3 and possibly Antarctic ice-sheet stability4. Meridional shifts of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds have been hypothesized to occur5,6 in parallel with the well-documented shifts of the intertropical convergence zone7 in response to Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events— abrupt North Atlantic climate change events of the last ice age. Shifting moisture pathways to West Antarctica8 are consistent with this view but may represent a Pacific teleconnection pattern forced from the tropics9. The full response of the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation to the DO cycle and its impact on Antarctic temperature remain unclear10. Here we use five ice cores synchronized via volcanic markers to show that the Antarctic temperature response to the DO cycle can be understood as the superposition of two modes: a spatially homogeneous oceanic ‘bipolar seesaw’ mode that lags behind Northern Hemisphere climate by about 200 years, and a spatially heterogeneous atmospheric mode that is synchronous with abrupt events in the Northern Hemisphere. Temperature anomalies of the atmospheric mode are similar to those associated with present-day Southern Annular Mode variability, rather than the Pacific–South American pattern. Moreover, deuterium-excess records suggest a zonally coherent migration of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds over all ocean basins in phase with Northern Hemisphere climate. Our work provides a simple conceptual framework for understanding circum-Antarctic temperature variations forced by abrupt Northern Hemisphere climate change. We provide observational evidence of abrupt shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, which have previously documented1–3 ramifications for global ocean circulation and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These coupled changes highlight the necessity of a global, rather than a purely North Atlantic, perspective on the DO cycle. The position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds responds immediately to abrupt North Atlantic climate events of the last ice age, with a spatially heterogeneous impact on Antarctic climate.","authors":"Christo Buizert; Michael Sigl; Mirko Severi; Bradley R.

{"abstract":"The transduction of extracellular signals through signaling pathways that culminate in a transcriptional response is central to many biological processes. However, quantitative relationships between activities of signaling pathway components and transcriptional output of target genes remain poorly explored. Here we developed a dual bioluminescence imaging strategy allowing simultaneous monitoring of nuclear translocation of the SMAD4 and SMAD2 transcriptional activators upon TGF-β stimulation, and the transcriptional response of the endogenous connective tissue growth factor (ctgf) gene. Using cell lines allowing to vary exogenous SMAD4/2 expression levels, we performed quantitative measurements of the temporal profiles of SMAD4/2 translocation and ctgf transcription kinetics in hundreds of individual cells at high temporal resolution. We found that while nuclear translocation efficiency had little impact on initial ctgf transcriptional activation, high total cellular SMAD4 but not SMAD2 levels increased the probability of cells to exhibit a sustained ctgf transcriptional response. The approach we present here allows time-resolved single cell quantification of transcription factor dynamics and transcriptional responses and thereby sheds light on the quantitative relationship between SMADs and target gene responses.","authors":"Onur Tidin; Elias T.

{"abstract":"The formation of hybrid light–molecule states (polaritons) offers a new strategy to manipulate the photochemistry of molecules. To fully exploit its potential, one needs to build a toolbox of polaritonic phenomenologies that supplement those of standard photochemistry. By means of a state-of-the-art computational photochemistry approach extended to the strong-coupling regime, here we disclose various mechanisms peculiar of polaritonic chemistry: coherent population oscillations between polaritons, quenching by trapping in dead-end polaritonic states and the alteration of the photochemical reaction pathway and quantum yields. We focus on azobenzene photoisomerization, that encompasses the essential features of complex photochemical reactions such as the presence of conical intersections and reaction coordinates involving multiple internal modes. In the strong coupling regime, a polaritonic conical intersection arises and we characterize its role in the photochemical process. Our chemically detailed simulations provide a framework to rationalize how the strong coupling impacts the photochemistry of realistic molecules. Manipulation of the photochemistry of molecules is traditionally achieved through synthetic chemical modifications. Here the authors use computational photochemistry to show how to control azobenzene photoisomerization through hybrid light–molecule states (polaritons).","authors":"J. Fregoni; G. Granucci; E.

{"abstract":"Temperate phages engage in long-term associations with their hosts that may lead to mutually beneficial interactions, of which the full extent is presently unknown. Here, we describe an environmentally relevant model system with a single host, a species of the Roseobacter clade of marine bacteria, and two genetically similar phages (ɸ-A and ɸ-D). Superinfection of a ɸ-D lysogenized strain (CB-D) with ɸ-A particles resulted in a lytic infection, prophage induction, and conversion of a subset of the host population, leading to isolation of a newly ɸ-A lysogenized strain (CB-A). Phenotypic differences, predicted to result from divergent lysogenic-lytic switch mechanisms, are evident between these lysogens, with CB-A displaying a higher incidence of spontaneous induction. Doubling times of CB-D and CB-A in liquid culture are 75 and 100 min, respectively. As cell cultures enter stationary phase, CB-A viable counts are half of CB-D. Consistent with prior evidence that cell lysis enhances biofilm formation, CB-A produces twice as much biofilm biomass as CB-D. As strains are susceptible to infection by the opposing phage type, co-culture competitions were performed to test fitness effects. When grown planktonically, CB-A outcompeted CB-D three to one. Yet, during biofilm growth, CB-D outcompeted CB-A three to one. These results suggest that genetically similar phages can have divergent influence on the competitiveness of their shared hosts in distinct environmental niches, possibly due to a complex form of phage-mediated allelopathy. These findings have implications for enhanced understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-phage interactions that are pervasive in all ecosystems.","authors":"Jonelle T. R. Basso; Nana Y.

{"abstract":"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are extragalactic X-ray emitters located off-centre of their host galaxy and with a luminosity in excess of a few 1039 erg s−1, if emitted isotropically1,2. The discovery of periodic modulation revealed that in some ULXs the accreting compact object is a neutron star3–7, indicating luminosities substantially above their Eddington limit. The most extreme object in this respect is NGC 5907 ULX-1 (ULX1), with a peak luminosity that is 500 times its Eddington limit. During a Chandra observation to probe a low state of ULX1, we detected diffuse X-ray emission at the position of ULX1. Its diameter is 2.7 ± 1.0 arcsec and contains 25 photons, none below 0.8 keV. We interpret this extended structure as an expanding nebula powered by the wind of ULX1. Its diameter of about 200 pc, characteristic energy of ~1.9 keV and luminosity of ~2 × 1038 erg s−1 imply a mechanical power of 1.3 × 1041 erg s−1 and an age of ~7 × 104 yr. This interpretation suggests that a genuinely super-Eddington regime can be sustained for timescales much longer than the spin-up time of the neutron star powering the system. As the mechanical power from a single ULX nebula can rival the injection rate of cosmic rays of an entire galaxy8, ULX nebulae could be important cosmic ray accelerators9. Diffuse X-ray emission is detected around an ultraluminous X-ray source, interpreted as a wind-powered expanding nebula. Its energetics suggests that a super-Eddington regime can be longer than the spin-up time of the central neutron star.","authors":"Andrea Belfiore; Paolo Esposito; Fabio Pintore; Giovanni Novara; Ruben Salvaterra; Andrea De Luca; Andrea Tiengo; Patrizia Caraveo; Felix Fürst; Gian Luca Israel; Danilo Magistrali; Martino Marelli; Sandro Mereghetti; Alessandro Papitto; Guillermo A.

{"abstract":"Patients with rare, undiagnosed, or genetic disease (RUGD) often undergo years of serial testing, commonly referred to as the “diagnostic odyssey”. Patients in resource-limited areas face even greater challenges—a definitive diagnosis may never be reached due to difficulties in gaining access to clinicians, appropriate specialists, and diagnostic testing. Here, we report on a collaboration of the Illumina iHope Program with the Foundation for the Children of the Californias and Hospital Infantil de Las Californias, to enable deployment of clinical whole genome sequencing (cWGS) as first-tier test in a resource-limited dysmorphology clinic in northern Mexico. A total of 60 probands who were followed for a suspected genetic diagnosis and clinically unresolved after expert examination were tested with cWGS, and the ordering clinicians completed a semi-structured survey to investigate change in clinical management resulting from cWGS findings. Clinically significant genomic findings were identified in 68.3% (n = 41) of probands. No recurrent molecular diagnoses were observed. Copy number variants or gross chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 48.8% (n = 20) of the diagnosed cases, including a mosaic trisomy and suspected derivative chromosomes. A qualitative assessment of clinical management revealed 48.8% (n = 20) of those diagnosed had a change in clinical course based on their cWGS results, despite resource limitations. These data suggest that a cWGS first-tier testing approach can benefit patients with suspected genetic disorders. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a valuable first-tier diagnostic test at pediatric clinics in resource-limited\u2028parts of the world, according to a study of children with suspected genetic disease treated in northern Mexico. A team led by Marilyn Jones from the Rady Children’s Hospital and Ryan Taft from Illumina Inc., both in San Diego, California, USA, describe a collaboration with a volunteer-led clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, where they offered genome sequencing for children with suspected genetic conditions—philanthropically through the iHope Program. Among the 60 families that participated, the clinical laboratory team identified genomic variants with diagnostic relevance in 41 (68%) cases. The genomic information contributed to changes in clinical management for 20 of these children, demonstrating the impact of WGS in places where patients generally don’t have access to medical specialists or other sophisticated molecular tests.","authors":"Alicia Scocchia; Kristen M.

{"abstract":"Mechanistic cadaver study. Patients in groups 4 and 5 of the International Classification for Surgery of the Hand in Tetraplegia have a few options for tendon transfer donors, but in general the needs for reestablishing motor power exceed the donor options, such that any increase in the number of potential transfers can enhance function. Although transfer of brachioradialis (BR) in these patients is well-established, pronator teres (PT) may also be a suitable donor due to its strength and excursion. It has not been extensively studied in this role, possibly because of concerns about its expendability as the major agonist of forearm pronation. The purpose of this study is to quantify forearm pronation capability pre- and post-tendon transfer of PT to flexor pollicis longus (FPL) in a cadaver model. Surgery center in Indianapolis, USA. Five cadaver arms were evaluated for pronation capability against gravity before and after PT to FPL tendon transfer. In both stages, the arms were also assessed for the pronation forces produced at the wrist when pulling PT with 25, 50, and 75 N of force. With each force, the arms were tested in full supination and neutral position. All five arms were capable of pronating against gravity before and after the PT to FPL tendon transfer. Following the transfer, pronation force at the wrist decreased by 1–5 N, but the change was not statistically significant. PT to FPL tendon transfer produces thumb flexion while retaining the forearm’s ability to pronate and would likely retain good clinical function, freeing up BR to recreate active finger flexion or extension.","authors":"Nathan P.

{"abstract":"Rab small GTPases play key roles in intracellular membrane trafficking. Rab33a promotes axon outgrowth of cultured rat hippocampal neurons by mediating the anterograde axonal transport of Golgi-derived vesicles and the concomitant exocytosis of these vesicles at the growth cone. However, the functions of Rab33 in vivo are unclear. Here, we show that zebrafish rab33a and rab33ba are orthologs of mammalian Rab33a and Rab33b, respectively. They are expressed in the developing brain, including in neurons of the telencephalic dorsorostral cluster and the diencephalic ventrorostral cluster, which project axons to form the anterior and postoptic commissures, respectively. Although rab33a single mutant and rab33ba single mutant fish did not show remarkable defects, fish carrying the rab33a;rab33ba double mutations displayed dysgenesis of the anterior and postoptic commissures. Single-cell labeling in the telencephalic dorsorostral cluster demonstrated that the rab33a;rab33ba double mutation inhibits axonal extension in the anterior commissure.

{"abstract":" Epichloë spp. are naturally occurring fungal endophytic symbionts of many cool-season grasses. Infection by the fungal endophytes often confers biotic and abiotic stress tolerance to their hosts. Endophyte-mediated disease resistance is well-established in the fine fescue grass Festuca rubra subsp. rubra (strong creeping red fescue) infected with E. festucae. Resistance to fungal pathogens is not an established effect of endophyte infection of other grass species, and may therefore be unique to the fine fescues. The underlying mechanism of the disease resistance is unknown. E. festucae produces a secreted antifungal protein that is highly expressed in the infected plant tissues and may therefore be involved in the disease resistance. Most Epichloë spp. do not have a gene for a similar antifungal protein. Here we report the characterization of the E. festucae antifungal protein, designated Efe-AfpA. The antifungal protein partially purified from the apoplastic proteins of endophyte-infected plant tissue and the recombinant protein expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris was found to have activity against the important plant pathogen Sclerotinia homoeocarpa. Efe-AfpA may therefore be a component of the disease resistance seen in endophyte-infected strong creeping red fescue.","authors":"Zipeng Tian; Ruying Wang; Karen V. Ambrose; Bruce B.

The primary outcome was the change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline. Fifty randomized controlled trials covering 15,494 patients were included. GLP-1RA showed the greatest HbA1c-lowering effect compared to the control (−0.84%; 95% credible interval, −1.00% to −0.69%), followed by TZD (−0.73%; −0.93 to −0.52%), SGLT2i (−0.66%; −0.84% to −0.48%), and DPP4i (−0.54%; −0.68% to −0.39%). SGLT2i showed the greatest fasting plasma glucose reduction. GLP-1RA and SGLT2i showed greater body weight reduction, whereas TZD increased body weight. TZD was ranked the highest in terms of insulin dose reduction. The risk of hypoglycemia was increased with TZD or GLP-1RA.

{"abstract":"The irradiation of silica with ions of specific energy larger than ~0.1 MeV/u produces very high electronic excitations that induce permanent changes in the physical, chemical and structural properties and give rise to defects (colour centres), responsible for the loss of sample transparency at specific bands. This type of irradiation leads to the generation of nanometer-sized tracks around the ion trajectory. In situ optical reflection measurements during systematic irradiation of silica samples allowed us to monitor the irradiation-induced compaction, whereas ex situ optical absorption measurements provide information on colour centre generation. In order to analyse the results, we have developed and validated an atomistic model able to quantitatively explain the experimental results. Thus, we are able to provide a consistent explanation for the size of the nanotracks, the velocity and thresholding effects for track formation, as well as, the colour centre yield per ion and the colour centre saturation density. In this work we will discuss the different processes involved in the permanent modification of silica: collective atomic motion, bond breaking, pressure-driven atom rearrangement and ultra-fast cooling. Despite the sudden lattice energy rise is the triggering and dominant step, all these processes are important for the final atomic configuration.","authors":"Antonio Rivera; José Olivares; Alejandro Prada; Miguel L.

{"abstract":"The predicted 50 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things by 2020 has renewed interest in polysilicon technology for high performance new sensing and control circuits, in addition to traditional display usage. Yet, the polycrystalline nature of the material presents significant challenges when used in transistors with strongly scaled channel lengths due to non-uniformity in device performance. For these new applications to materialize as viable products, uniform electrical characteristics on large areas will be essential. Here, we report on the effect of deliberately engineered potential barrier at the source of polysilicon thin-film transistors, yielding highly-uniform on-current (\u003c8% device-to-device, accounting for material, as well as substantial geometrical, variations). The contact-controlled architecture of these transistors significantly reduces kink effect and produces high intrinsic gain over a wide range of drain voltage (2–20 V). TCAD simulations associate critical grain boundary position and the two current injection mechanisms in this type of device, showing that, for the geometry considered, the most unfavorable location is ~150 nm inside the source area. At this point, grain boundary contributes to increasing the resistance of the source pinch-off region, reducing the current injection from the bulk of the source area. Nevertheless, the effect is marginal, and the probability of a grain boundary existing at this position is low. This new understanding is instrumental in the design of new signal conversion and gain circuits for flexible and low-power sensors, without the need for complex compensation methods.","authors":"Radu A.

{"abstract":"Heterogeneous interfaces exhibit the unique phenomena by the redistribution of charged species to equilibrate the chemical potentials. Despite recent studies on the electronic charge accumulation across chemically inert interfaces, the systematic research to investigate massive reconfiguration of charged ions has been limited in heterostructures with chemically reacting interfaces so far. Here, we demonstrate that a chemical potential mismatch controls oxygen ionic transport across TiO2/VO2 interfaces, and that this directional transport unprecedentedly stabilizes high-quality rutile TiO2 epitaxial films at the lowest temperature (≤ 150 °C) ever reported, at which rutile phase is difficult to be crystallized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this unconventional low-temperature epitaxy of rutile TiO2 phase is achieved by lowering the activation barrier by increasing the “effective” oxygen pressure through a facile ionic pathway from VO2-δ sacrificial templates. This discovery shows a robust control of defect-induced properties at oxide interfaces by the mismatch of thermodynamic driving force, and also suggests a strategy to overcome a kinetic barrier to phase stabilization at exceptionally low temperature. The research to utilize chemical potential mismatch for materials synthesis has been limited across the oxide interface. Here, the authors show that directional ionic transport from the VO2 layers stabilizes the rutile TiO2 phase at extremely low temperatures, at which epitaxy is difficult, by effectively lowering the activation barrier for crystallization.","authors":"Yunkyu Park; Hyeji Sim; Minguk Jo; Gi-Yeop Kim; Daseob Yoon; Hyeon Han; Younghak Kim; Kyung Song; Donghwa Lee; Si-Young Choi; Junwoo Son","keywords":"Electronic properties and materials; Surfaces, interfaces and thin films","organization_affiliated":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Halle (Saale), Germany; Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Republic of Korea; Materials Modeling and Characterization Department, Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), Changwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea","title":"Directional ionic transport across the oxide interface enables low-temperature epitaxy of rutile TiO 2","id":"030e70d6-00f9-4fdf-97b7-cdc269cf0d94"}
{"abstract":"How invasive species overcome challenges associated with low genetic diversity is unclear. Invasive ant populations with low genetic diversity sometimes produce sterile diploid males, which do not contribute to colony labour or reproductive output. We investigated how inbreeding affects colony founding and potential strategies to overcome its effects in the invasive tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata. Our genetic analyses of field samples revealed that 13–100% of males per colony (n = 8 males per 10 colonies) were diploid, and that all newly mated queens (n = 40) were single-mated. Our laboratory experiment in which we assigned newly mated queens to nests consisting of 1, 2, 3, or 5 queens (n = 95 ± 9 replicates) revealed that pleometrosis (queens founding their nest together) and diploid male larvae execution can compensate for diploid male load. The proportion of diploid male producing (DMP) colonies was 22.4%, and DMP colonies produced fewer pupae and adult workers than non-DMP colonies. Pleometrosis significantly increased colony size. Queens executed their diploid male larvae in 43.5% of the DMP colonies, and we hypothesize that cannibalism benefits incipient colonies because queens can redirect nutrients to worker brood. Pleometrosis and cannibalism of diploid male larvae represent strategies through which invasive ants can successfully establish despite high inbreeding.","authors":"Pauline Lenancker; Benjamin D.

{"abstract":"Super-resolution optical microscopy based on stimulated emission depletion effects can now be performed at much lower light intensities than before by using bright upconversion emission from thulium-doped nanoparticles. Improvements in super-resolution optical microscopy based on stimulated emission depletion (STED) effects have a problem: they are typically limited by a 'square-root law' regarding the number of photons required to achieve a gain in resolution. Yujia Liu and colleagues have found a way to bypass this troublesome law. As others have done before them, they adopt lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles as the emitting species used to achieve high-resolution imaging. The difference this time is that the laser-like absorption and emission properties of these nanoparticles are engineered to facilitate STED-like microscopy at much lower light intensities. Lanthanide-doped glasses and crystals are attractive for laser applications because the metastable energy levels of the trivalent lanthanide ions facilitate the establishment of population inversion and amplified stimulated emission at relatively low pump power1,2,3. At the nanometre scale, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can now be made with precisely controlled phase, dimension and doping level4,5. When excited in the near-infrared, these UCNPs emit stable, bright visible luminescence at a variety of selectable wavelengths6,7,8,9, with single-nanoparticle sensitivity10,11,12,13, which makes them suitable for advanced luminescence microscopy applications. Here we show that UCNPs doped with high concentrations of thulium ions (Tm3+), excited at a wavelength of 980 nanometres, can readily establish a population inversion on their intermediate metastable 3H4 level: the reduced inter-emitter distance at high Tm3+ doping concentration leads to intense cross-relaxation, inducing a photon-avalanche-like effect that rapidly populates the metastable 3H4 level, resulting in population inversion relative to the 3H6 ground level within a single nanoparticle. As a result, illumination by a laser at 808 nanometres, matching the upconversion band of the 3H4 → 3H6 transition, can trigger amplified stimulated emission to discharge the 3H4 intermediate level, so that the upconversion pathway to generate blue luminescence can be optically inhibited. We harness these properties to realize low-power super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and achieve nanometre-scale optical resolution (nanoscopy), imaging single UCNPs; the resolution is 28 nanometres, that is, 1/36th of the wavelength. These engineered nanocrystals offer saturation intensity two orders of magnitude lower than those of fluorescent probes currently employed in stimulated emission depletion microscopy, suggesting a new way of alleviating the square-root law that typically limits the resolution that can be practically achieved by such techniques.","authors":"Yujia Liu; Yiqing Lu; Xusan Yang; Xianlin Zheng; Shihui Wen; Fan Wang; Xavier Vidal; Jiangbo Zhao; Deming Liu; Zhiguang Zhou; Chenshuo Ma; Jiajia Zhou; James A.

{"abstract":"β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin share a very unstable chemical structure. In water-based solutions, such as those used for clinical applications, the β-lactam ring is readily opened due to a nucleophilic or electrophilic attack, leading to the loss of antimicrobial activity. Since the achievement and maintenance of optimum therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics is critical for the resolution of many infectious clinical situations, and to avoid antibiotic resistance generation, the design of new non-aqueous dosage forms is urgent. Recently, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have emerged as alternative non-toxic and non-aqueous solvents for different biomedical applications. In this work, we formulated and characterized a NADES composed by betaine and urea (BU). Using this solvent, we evaluated the stability of clavulanic acid (CLV) and imipenem (IMP) and characterized their antimicrobial activities calculating the minimal inhibitory concentration. Characterization of BU solvent by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) indicated that the obtained solvent has a microstructure mainly based on hydrogen bonding interactions and water addition strongly affects its dynamic. The stability of β-lactam antibiotic IMP and CLV using this solvent was increased by 7 fold and 2.5 fold respectively compared to water when analysed seven days after being dissolved. Microbiological assays showed that antibacterial activity at day seven was significantly decreased for both CLV and IMP when dissolved in water, while no change in their antibacterial properties was observed when antibiotics were dissolved in BU. The increased stability of IMP and CLV in BU may be related to the inert behaviour of the solvent and the higher dynamic restriction that helps antibiotics to maintain a more stable conformation. These data suggest the potential use of BU as a solvent to prevent degradation of β-lactam antibiotics.","authors":"Belén Olivares; Fabián Martínez; Lina Rivas; Cristian Calderón; José M.

{"abstract":"The nucleolar factor, digestive organ expansion factor (DEF), has a key role in ribosome biogenesis, functioning in pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing as a component of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome. Here we show that the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (PSNS) is very underdeveloped in def-deficient zebrafish, and that def haploinsufficiency significantly decreases disease penetrance and tumor growth rate in a MYCN-driven transgenic zebrafish model of neuroblastoma that arises in the PSNS. Consistent with these findings, DEF is highly expressed in human neuroblastoma, and its depletion in human neuroblastoma cell lines induces apoptosis. Interestingly, overexpression of MYCN in zebrafish and in human neuroblastoma cells results in the appearance of intermediate pre-rRNAs species that reflect the processing of pre-rRNAs through Pathway 2, a pathway that processes pre-rRNAs in a different temporal order than the more often used Pathway 1. Our results indicate that DEF and possibly other components of the SSU processome provide a novel site of vulnerability in neuroblastoma cells that could be exploited for targeted therapy.","authors":"T Tao; S B Sondalle; H Shi; S Zhu; A R Perez-Atayde; J Peng; S J Baserga; A T Look","keywords":"Cancer models; Paediatric cancer","organization_affiliated":"Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine, Rochester, USA; Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, ; Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine, Rochester, USA; Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Departments of Molecular Biophysics \u0026 Biochemistry, Genetics and Therapeutic Radiology, Yale University and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","title":"The pre-rRNA processing factor DEF is rate limiting for the pathogenesis of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma","id":"b67b7137-4bec-40a4-8a31-6179f1fd5962"}
{"abstract":"D-2-Hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) is regarded as an oncometabolite. It is found at elevated levels in certain malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia and glioma. It is produced by a mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1/2, a low-affinity/high-capacity enzyme. Its degradation, in contrast, is catalysed by the high-affinity/low-capacity enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HDH). So far, it has not been proven experimentally that the accumulation of D-2-HG in IDH mutant cells is the result of its insufficient degradation by D2HDH. Therefore, we developed an LC-MS/MS-based enzyme activity assay that measures the temporal drop in substrate and compared this to the expression of D2HDH protein as measured by Western blot. Our data clearly indicate, that the maximum D-2-HG degradation rate by D2HDH is reached in vivo, as vmax is low in comparison to production of D-2-HG by mutant IDH1/2. The latter seems to be limited only by substrate availability. Further, incubation of IDH wild type cells for up to 48 hours with 5 mM D-2-HG did not result in a significant increase in either D2HDH protein abundance or enzyme activity.","authors":"Raffaela S.

{"abstract":"Interaction between magma and crustal carbonate at active arc volcanoes has recently been proposed as a source of atmospheric CO2, in addition to CO2 released from the mantle and subducted oceanic crust. However, quantitative constraints on efficiency and timing of these processes are poorly established. Here, we present the first in situ carbon and oxygen isotope data of texturally distinct calcite in calc-silicate xenoliths from arc volcanics in a case study from Merapi volcano (Indonesia). Textures and C-O isotopic data provide unique evidence for decarbonation, magma-fluid interaction, and the generation of carbonate melts. We report extremely light δ13CPDB values down to −29.3‰ which are among the lowest reported in magmatic systems so far. Combined with the general paucity of relict calcite, these extremely low values demonstrate highly efficient remobilisation of crustal CO2 over geologically short timescales of thousands of years or less. This rapid release of large volumes of crustal CO2 may impact global carbon cycling.","authors":"Sean Whitley; Ralf Gertisser; Ralf Halama; Katie Preece; Valentin R. Troll; Frances M.

{"abstract":"Myxofibrosarcomas are morphologically heterogeneous soft tissue sarcomas lacking a specific immunohistochemical expression profile and recurrent genetic changes. The study was designed to gain further insights into the molecular landscape of myxofibrosarcomas by targeted re-sequencing of known cancer driver hotspot mutations and the analysis of genomewide somatic copy number alterations. A well-defined group of myxofibrosarcomas, including myxofibrosarcomas G1 (n=6), myxofibrosarcomas G3 (n=7), myxofibrosarcomas with morphologically heterogeneous and independently selectable G1 and G3 areas within a tumor (n=8), and myxofibrosarcomas G3 with subsequent tumor recurrence (n=1) or metastatic disease (n=3) were evaluated. Mutational analysis demonstrated mutations in TP53, PTEN, FGFR3, CDKN2A, and RB1. TP53 mutations were seen in 11 (44%) of patients and detected in myxofibrosarcomas G1, G3, with heterogeneous morphology and G3 with subsequent metastases in 1 patient (16%), 3 patients (42%), 2 patients (62.5%), and 3 patients (75%), respectively. Additional mutations were detected in 2 patients, intratumoral mutational heterogeneity in 1 patient. We observed a variety of copy number alterations typical for myxofibrosarcomas, with higher numbers in G3 compared with G1 myxofibrosarcomas. Cluster analysis revealed distinctive features especially in metastatic and recurrent disease. Focal alterations affected CDKN2A, CCND1, CCNE1, EGFR, EPHA3, EPHB1, FGFR1, JUN, NF1, RB1, RET, TP53, and additional novel amplifications in CCNE1, KIT, EGFR, RET, BRAF, NTRK2 were seen in G3 compared with the G1 tumor areas. The total number of focal events in G1 versus G3 tumors differed significantly (P=0.0014). TRIO and RICTOR co-amplification was seen in 8 (44%) G3 and 1 (10%) G1 myxofibrosarcomas and RICTOR amplification alone in 4 (40%) G1 myxofibrosarcomas. TRIO amplification was significantly (P=0.0218) higher in G3 myxofibrosarcomas indicating a late genetic event. These findings support the use of expanded molecular profiling in myxofibrosarcomas to detect drug-able targets to allow patients to participate in basket trials.","authors":"Ellen Heitzer; Sandra Sunitsch; Magdalena M Gilg; Birgit Lohberger; Beate Rinner; Karl Kashofer; Nicole Stündl; Peter Ulz; Joanna Szkandera; Andreas Leithner; Bernadette Liegl-Atzwanger","keywords":"Genetics research; Preclinical research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Human Genetics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Division of Biomedical Research, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Human Genetics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Division of Clinical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria","title":"Expanded molecular profiling of myxofibrosarcoma reveals potentially actionable targets","id":"1cca7ee8-444c-4878-a80a-50ca1fd66dd4"}
{"abstract":"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a large group of chaperones considered critical for maintaining cellular proteostasis. Their aberrant expression in tumors can modulate the course of processes defined as hallmarks of cancer. Previously, we showed that both stress-inducible HSPA1 and testis-enriched HSPA2, highly homologous members of the HSPA (HSP70) family, are often overexpressed in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). HSPA1 is among the best characterized cancer-related chaperones, while the significance of HSPA2 for cancer remains poorly understood. Previously we found that in primary NSCLC, HSPA1 was associated with good prognosis while HSPA2 correlated with bad prognosis, suggesting possible different roles of these proteins in cancer. Therefore, in this work we investigated the impact of HSPA1 and HSPA2 on NSCLC cell phenotype. We found that neither paralog-selective nor simultaneous knockdown of HSPA1 and HSPA2 gene expression reduced growth and chemoresistance of NSCLC cells. Only blocking of HSPA proteins using pan-HSPA inhibitors, VER-155008 or JG-98, exerted potent anticancer effect on NSCLC cells, albeit the final outcome was cell type-dependent. Pan-HSPA inhibition sensitized NSCLC cells to bortezomib, but not to platinum derivates. Our result suggests the inhibitors of proteasome and HSPAs seem an effective drug combination for pre-clinical development in highly aggressive NSCLC.","authors":"Damian Robert Sojka; Agnieszka Gogler-Pigłowska; Natalia Vydra; Alexander Jorge Cortez; Piotr Teodor Filipczak; Zdzisław Krawczyk; Dorota Scieglinska","keywords":"Cancer therapeutic resistance; Non-small-cell lung cancer","organization_affiliated":"Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Lung Cancer Program, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, USA; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland; Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland","title":"Functional redundancy of HSPA1, HSPA2 and other HSPA proteins in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC); an implication for NSCLC treatment","id":"865f1b82-693a-455f-bc6a-f95033f440c2"}

A closed-loop all-optical strategy allows manipulation of neurons on the basis of their ongoing activity and can be used to clamp neuronal activity to a preset level, boost sensory-evoked activity or yoke together the activity of trigger and target neurons.","authors":"Zihui Zhang; Lloyd E.

{"abstract":"Tobacco smoking is the world’s leading cause of premature death and disability. Global targets to reduce premature deaths by 25% by 2025 will require a substantial increase in the number of smokers making a quit attempt, and a significant improvement in the success rates of those attempts in low, middle and high income countries. In many countries the only place where the majority of smokers can access support to quit is primary care. There is strong evidence of cost-effective interventions in primary care yet many opportunities to put these into practice are missed. This paper revises the approach proposed by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group published in 2008 in this journal to reflect important new evidence and the global variation in primary-care experience and knowledge of smoking cessation. Specific for primary care, that advocates for a holistic, bio-psycho-social approach to most problems, the starting point is to approach tobacco dependence as an eminently treatable condition. We offer a hierarchy of interventions depending on time and available resources. We present an equitable approach to behavioural and drug interventions. This includes an update to the evidence on behaviour change, gender difference, comparative information on numbers needed to treat, drug safety and availability of drugs, including the relatively cheap drug cytisine, and a summary of new approaches such as harm reduction. This paper also extends the guidance on special populations such as people with long-term conditions including tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, pregnant women, children and adolescents, and people with serious mental illness. We use expert clinical opinion where the research evidence is insufficient or inconclusive. The paper describes trends in the use of waterpipes and cannabis smoking and offers guidance to primary-care clinicians on what to do faced with uncertain evidence. Throughout, it recognises that clinical decisions should be tailored to the individual’s circumstances and attitudes and be influenced by the availability and affordability of drugs and specialist services. Finally it argues that the role of the International Primary Care Respiratory Group is to improve the confidence as well as the competence of primary care and, therefore, makes recommendations about clinical education and evaluation. We also advocate for an update to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines to optimise each primary-care intervention.

{"abstract":"Human Kinesin-5 (Eg5) has a large number of known allosteric inhibitors that disrupt its mitotic function. Small-molecule inhibitors of Eg5 are candidate anti-cancer agents and important probes for understanding the cellular function. Here we show that Eg5 is capable of more than one type of microtubule interaction, and these activities can be controlled by allosteric agents. While both monastrol and S-trityl-L-cysteine inhibit Eg5 motility, our data reveal an unexpected ability of these loop5 targeting inhibitors to differentially control a novel Eg5 microtubule depolymerizing activity. Remarkably, small molecule loop5 effectors are able to independently modulate discrete functional interactions between the motor and microtubule track. We establish that motility can be uncoupled from the microtubule depolymerase activity and argue that loop5-targeting inhibitors of Kinesin-5 should not all be considered functionally synonymous. Also, the depolymerizing activity of the motor does not contribute to the genesis of monopolar spindles during allosteric inhibition of motility, but instead reveals a new function. We propose that, in addition to its canonical role in participating in the construction of the three-dimensional mitotic spindle structure, Eg5 also plays a distinct role in regulating the dynamics of individual microtubules, and thereby impacts the density of the mitotic spindle.","authors":"Catherine D.

Previous computer simulations advanced a myriad of mechanisms to rationalize shear banding. However, they were restricted to planar geometries. We investigate the relevance of anisotropic plasticity by picking an axisymmetric tensile test rig, in which shear localization is rarely observed. The three-dimensional finite-element simulations of shear banding in this type of specimens are the first of their kind. The micromechanical modeling covers a range of competing mechanisms believed to be responsible for such failure. We show that anisotropic plasticity can effectively trigger shear bands thereby causing failure of ductile solids. Our results enable shear fracture to be rationalized in ductile rocks and mitigated against in designing advanced materials.","authors":"A. Amine Benzerga; Nithin Thomas; Joshua S.

{"abstract":"Microalgae of the genus Chlorella vulgaris are candidates for the production of lipids for biofuel production. Besides that, Chlorella vulgaris is marketed as protein and vitamin rich food additive. Its potential as a novel expression system for recombinant proteins inspired us to study its asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycans) by mass spectrometry, chromatography and gas chromatography. Oligomannosidic N-glycans with up to nine mannoses were the structures found in culture collection strains as well as several commercial products. These glycans co-eluted with plant N-glycans in the highly shape selective porous graphitic carbon chromatography. Thus, Chlorella vulgaris generates oligomannosidic N-glycans of the structural type known from land plants and animals. In fact, Man5 (Man5GlcNAc2) served as substrate for GlcNAc-transferase I and a trace of an endogenous structure with terminal GlcNAc was seen. The unusual more linear Man5 structure recently found on glycoproteins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii occurred - if at all - in traces only. Notably, a majority of the oligomannosidic glycans was multiply O-methylated with 3-O-methyl and 3,6-di-O-methyl mannoses at the non-reducing termini. This modification has so far been neither found on plant nor vertebrate N-glycans. It’s possible immunogenicity raises concerns as to the use of C. vulgaris for production of pharmaceutical glycoproteins.","authors":"Réka Mócsai; Rudolf Figl; Clemens Troschl; Richard Strasser; Elisabeth Svehla; Markus Windwarder; Andreas Thader; Friedrich Altmann","keywords":"Chemical biology; Plant biotechnology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; Department of Agrobiotechnology Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Tulln an der Donau, Austria; Department of Applied Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; Fresenius Medical Care Adsorber Tec GmbH, Krems, Austria; Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; Shire, Process Development \u0026 Technical Services, Vienna, Austria; Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria; IST Austria, Am Campus 1, Klosterneuburg, Austria; Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria","title":"N-glycans of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris are of the oligomannosidic type but highly methylated","id":"0cf0036b-4eb6-44a3-99cc-97995b27f92d"}
{"abstract":"Success of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is founded on nationally determined contributions (NDCs), hinges on whether domestic support for international environmental agreements would be undermined if countries that are crucial to the global effort fail to reduce their emissions. Here we find that citizens in China (n = 3,000) and the United States (n = 3,007) have strong preferences over the design of international climate agreements and contributions of other countries to the global effort. However, contrary to what standard accounts of international politics would predict, a survey-embedded experiment in which respondents were randomly exposed to different information on other countries’ behaviour showed that information on other countries failing to reduce their emissions does not undermine support for how international agreements are designed. While other factors still make large emission cuts challenging, these results suggest that the Paris approach per se is not posing a problem. Climate change mitigation requires cooperation among nations, which could be undermined if a major emitter defects from international agreements. This study shows that public support for global climate policies is unaffected by information on other countries failing to reduce their emissions.","authors":"Liam F.

{"abstract":"Rod photoreceptor synapses use large, ribbon-type active zones for continuous synaptic transmission during light and dark. Since ribbons are physically connected to the active zones, we asked whether illumination-dependent changes of ribbons influence Cav1.4/RIM2 protein clusters at the active zone and whether these illumination-dependent effects at the active zone require the presence of the synaptic ribbon. We found that synaptic ribbon length and the length of presynaptic Cav1.4/RIM2 clusters are tightly correlated. Dark-adaptation did not change the number of ribbons and active zone puncta. However, mean ribbon length and length of presynaptic Cav1.4/RIM2 clusters increased significantly during dark-adaptation when tonic exocytosis is highest. In the present study, we identified by the analyses of synaptic ribbon-deficient RIBEYE knockout mice that synaptic ribbons are (1) needed to stabilize Cav1.4/RIM2 at rod photoreceptor active zones and (2) are required for the darkness-induced active zone enrichment of Cav1.4/RIM2. These data propose a role of the ribbon in active zone stabilization and suggest a homeostatic function of the ribbon in illumination-dependent active zone remodeling.","authors":"Ekta Dembla; Mayur Dembla; Stephan Maxeiner; Frank Schmitz","keywords":"Retina; Synaptic vesicle exocytosis","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Neuroanatomy, Saarland University, Medical School, Homburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Neuroanatomy, Saarland University, Medical School, Homburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Neuroanatomy, Saarland University, Medical School, Homburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Saarland University, AG Krasteva-Christ, Homburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Neuroanatomy, Saarland University, Medical School, Homburg, Germany","title":"Synaptic ribbons foster active zone stability and illumination-dependent active zone enrichment of RIM2 and Cav1.4 in photoreceptor synapses","id":"b7fbfda8-f03b-4925-80cb-5f9625819033"}
{"abstract":"Persistent shortage and heterogeneous quality of liver grafts encourages the optimization of donor-recipient matching in liver transplantation (LT). We explored whether or not there was a survival benefit (SB) of LT according to the quality of grafts assessed by the Donor Quality Index (DQI) and recipients’ disease severity, using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) in 8387 French patients wait-listed between 2009 and 2014. SB associated with LT was estimated using the sequential stratification method in different categories of MELD and DQI. For each transplantation, a stratum was created that matched one transplanted patient with all eligible control candidates. Strata were thereafter combined, and a stratified Cox model, adjusted for covariates, was fitted in order to estimate hazard ratios that qualified the SB according to each MELD and DQI sub-group. A significant SB was observed for all MELD and DQI sub-groups, with the exception of high MELD patients transplanted with “high-risk” grafts. More specifically, in decompensated-cirrhosis patients, “high-risk” grafts did not appear to be detrimental in medium MELD patients. Interestingly, in hepatocellular-carcinoma (HCC) patients, a significant SB was found for all MELD-DQI combinations. For MELD exceptions no SB was found. In terms of SB, “low-risk” grafts appeared appropriate for most severe patients (MELD \u003e 30). Conversely, low/medium MELD and HCC patients presented an SB while allocated “high-risk” grafts. Thus, SB based matching rules for LT candidates might improve the survival of the LT population as a whole.","authors":"Audrey Winter; Cyrille Féray; Corinne Antoine; Daniel Azoulay; Jean-Pierre Daurès; Paul Landais","keywords":"Epidemiology; Liver cancer; Liver cirrhosis; Statistics","organization_affiliated":"University of Montpellier, Department of Biostatistics, UPRES EA2415, Clinical Reasearch University Institute, Montpellier, France; Beau Soleil Clinic, Languedoc Mutualité, Montpellier, France; Department of Radiological Sciences, Medical Imaging \u0026 Informatics, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; Centre Hépato-Biliaire, INSERM 1193, Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France; Agence de Biomédecine, Saint-Denis, France; Centre Hépato-Biliaire, INSERM 1193, Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France; University of Montpellier, Department of Biostatistics, UPRES EA2415, Clinical Reasearch University Institute, Montpellier, France; Beau Soleil Clinic, Languedoc Mutualité, Montpellier, France; University of Montpellier, Department of Biostatistics, UPRES EA2415, Clinical Reasearch University Institute, Montpellier, France","title":"Matching Graft Quality to Recipient’s Disease Severity Based on the Survival Benefit in Liver Transplantation","id":"4d45e222-b453-4280-8592-06b0f8114153"}
{"abstract":"Equatorial Southeast Asia is a key region for global climate change. Here, the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) is a critical driver of atmospheric convection that plays a dominant role in global atmospheric circulation. However, fluctuating sea-levels during the Pleistocene produced the most drastic land-sea area changes on Earth, with the now-drowned continent of Sundaland being exposed as a contiguous landmass for most of the past 2 million years. How vegetation responded to changes in rainfall that resulted from changing shelf exposure and glacial boundary conditions in Sundaland remains poorly understood. Here we use the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of bat guano and High Molecular Weight n-alkanes, from Saleh Cave in southern Borneo to demonstrate that open vegetation existed during much the past 40,000 yrs BP. This location is at the southern equatorial end of a hypothesized ‘savanna corridor’ and the results provide the strongest evidence yet for its existence. The corridor would have operated as a barrier to east-west dispersal of rainforest species, and a conduit for north-south dispersal of savanna species at times of lowered sea level, explaining many modern biogeographic patterns. The Saleh Cave record also exhibits a strong correspondence with insolation and sea surface temperatures of the IPWP, suggesting a strong sensitivity of vegetation to tropical climate change on glacial/interglacial timeframes.","authors":"Christopher M.

{"abstract":"Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an allotetraploid species derived from recent whole genome duplication and provides a model to study polyploid genome evolution in vertebrates. Here, we generate three chromosome-level reference genomes of C. carpio and compare to related diploid Cyprinid genomes. We identify a Barbinae lineage as potential diploid progenitor of C. carpio and then divide the allotetraploid genome into two subgenomes marked by a distinct genome similarity to the diploid progenitor. We estimate that the two diploid progenitors diverged around 23 Mya and merged around 12.4 Mya based on the divergence rates of homoeologous genes and transposable elements in two subgenomes. No extensive gene losses are observed in either subgenome. Instead, we find gene expression bias across surveyed tissues such that subgenome B is more dominant in homoeologous expression. CG methylation in promoter regions may play an important role in altering gene expression in allotetraploid C. carpio. The common carp is derived from recent whole genome duplication and represents a model for polyploid genome evolution, rare in vertebrates.

{"abstract":"Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are key modulators of signal transduction and are involved in inflammatory cell activation, memory and cognition. There is a two-fold decrease in the expression of phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) in the temporal cortex of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Here, we studied PDE8A mRNA-editing profile in two architectonically distinct neocortical regions in a clinically well-characterized cohort of age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls and depressed suicide decedents. By using capillary electrophoresis single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), a previously validated technique to identify A-to-I RNA modifications, we report the full editing profile of PDE8A in the brain, including identification of two novel editing sites. Editing of PDE8A mRNA displayed clear regional difference when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24). Furthermore, we report significant intra-regional differences between non-psychiatric control individuals and depressed suicide decedents, which could discriminate the two populations. Taken together, our results (i) highlight the importance of immune/inflammatory markers in major depressive disorder and suicide and (ii) establish a direct relationship between A-to-I RNA modifications of peripheral markers and A-to-I RNA editing-related modifications in brain. This work provides the first immune response-related brain marker for suicide and could pave the way for the identification of a blood-based biomarker that predicts suicidal behavior.","authors":"Fabrice Chimienti; Laurent Cavarec; Laurent Vincent; Nicolas Salvetat; Victoria Arango; Mark D.

{"abstract":"Our knowledge on the behaviour of the geomagnetic field through time critically depends on how information of the past state of the field is recorded by, and stored in iron-bearing minerals such as magnetite. For small, single domain grains these processes are described by classical Néel theory, but the magnetic behaviour of larger, pseudo-single domain or multidomain grains, still is enigmatic. Here we present a chemical, crystallographic and magnetic characterisation of three to six individual, large (~3–10 μm) iron-oxide grains from eleven different flows sampled on the Big Island of Hawai’i. These grains were all subjected to a Magnetic Force Microscopy study to characterise their magnetic domain structure; a Microprobe analyses to assess their chemical composition; and a Scanning Electron Microscopy study to identify phases and crystallographic orientations. This comprehensive dataset enables systematic analyses of their magnetic behaviour as function of chemistry and forms the basis for future micromagnetic modelling studies eventually contributing to the development of a fundamental theory of magnetic behaviour in large iron-oxide grains.

{"abstract":"Pontin (Pont), also known as Tip49, encodes a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities) superfamily and plays pivotal roles in cell proliferation and growth, yet its function in cell death has remained poorly understood. Here we performed a genetic screen for dominant modifiers of Eiger-induced JNK-dependent cell death in Drosophila, and identified Pont as a negative regulator of JNK-mediated cell death. In addition, loss of function of Pont is sufficient to induce cell death and activate the transcription of JNK target gene puc. Furthermore, the epistasis analysis indicates that Pont acts downstream of Hep. Finally, we found that Pont is also required for JNK-mediated thorax development and acts as a negative regulator of JNK phosphorylation. Together, our data suggest that pont encodes a negative component of Egr/JNK signaling pathway in Drosophila through negatively regulating JNK phosphorylation, which provides a novel role of ATPase in Egr-JNK signaling.","authors":"Xingjun Wang; Xirui Huang; Chenxi Wu; Lei Xue","keywords":"Developmental biology; Genetics","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Intervention Vessel, Shanghai 10th People’s Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Diseases Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Department of Neuroscience, Scripps Research Institute, Florida, Jupiter, USA; Institute of Intervention Vessel, Shanghai 10th People’s Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Diseases Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; College of Chinese Medicine, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, China; Institute of Intervention Vessel, Shanghai 10th People’s Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Diseases Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","title":"Pontin/Tip49 negatively regulates JNK-mediated cell death in Drosophila","id":"acd7a823-dab7-47cb-aaec-c8e35785b22f"}

{"abstract":"Humic substances (HS) are complex natural mixtures comprising a large variety of compounds produced during decomposition of decaying biomass. The molecular composition of HS is extremely diverse as it was demonstrated with the use of high resolution mass spectrometry. The building blocks of HS are mostly represented by plant-derived biomolecules (lignins, lipids, tannins, carbohydrates, etc.). As a result, HS show a wide spectrum of biological activity. Despite that, HS remain a ‘biological activity black-box’ due to unknown structures of constituents responsible for the interaction with molecular targets. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of eight HS fractions isolated from peat and coal, as well as of two synthetic humic-like materials. We determined molecular compositions of the corresponding samples using ultra-high resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass-spectrometry (FTICR MS). Inhibitory activity of HS was studied with respect to reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which is a representative of Flavivirus genus, and to a panel of enteroviruses (EVs). The samples of natural HS inhibited TBEV reproduction already at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, but they did not inhibit reproduction of EVs. We found that the total relative intensity of FTICR MS formulae within elemental composition range commonly attributed to flavonoid-like structures is correlating with the activity of the samples. In order to surmise on possible active structural components of HS, we mined formulae within FTICR MS assignments in the ChEMBL database. Out of 6502 formulae within FTICR MS assignments, 3852 were found in ChEMBL. There were more than 71 thousand compounds related to these formulae in ChEMBL. To support chemical relevance of these compounds to natural HS we applied the previously developed approach of selective isotopic exchange coupled to FTICR MS to obtain structural information on the individual components of HS. This enabled to propose compounds from ChEMBL, which corroborated the labeling data. The obtained results provide the first insight onto the possible structures, which comprise antiviral components of HS and, respectively, can be used for further disclosure of antiviral activity mechanism of HS.","authors":"Alexey A.

{"abstract":"With advances in connectomics, transcriptome and neurophysiological technologies, the neuroscience of brain-wide neural circuits is poised to take off. A major challenge is to understand how a vast diversity of functions is subserved by parcellated areas of mammalian neocortex composed of repetitions of a canonical local circuit. Areas of the cerebral cortex differ from each other not only in their input–output patterns but also in their biological properties. Recent experimental and theoretical work has revealed that such variations are not random heterogeneities; rather, synaptic excitation and inhibition display systematic macroscopic gradients across the entire cortex, and they are abnormal in mental illness. Quantitative differences along these gradients can lead to qualitatively novel behaviours in non-linear neural dynamical systems, by virtue of a phenomenon mathematically described as bifurcation. The combination of macroscopic gradients and bifurcations, in tandem with biological evolution, development and plasticity, provides a generative mechanism for functional diversity among cortical areas, as a general principle of large-scale cortical organization. Certain biological properties vary across different areas of the cerebral cortex. In this Perspective, Xiao-Jing Wang proposes that macroscopic gradients in some properties align with functional hierarchy and can lead to qualitative differences in function.","authors":"Xiao-Jing Wang","keywords":"Dynamical systems; Network models; Neural circuits; Neuronal physiology; Working memory","organization_affiliated":"Center for Neural Science, New York University, New York, USA","title":"Macroscopic gradients of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the neocortex","id":"0d390b34-68d7-4b47-a9cc-0f21daf53928"}
{"abstract":"Levels of certain circulating cytokines and related immune system molecules are consistently altered in schizophrenia and related disorders. In addition to absolute analyte levels, we sought analytes in correlation networks that could be prognostic. We analyzed baseline blood plasma samples with a Luminex platform from 72 subjects meeting criteria for a psychosis clinical high-risk syndrome; 32 subjects converted to a diagnosis of psychotic disorder within two years while 40 other subjects did not. Another comparison group included 35 unaffected subjects. Assays of 141 analytes passed early quality control. We then used an unweighted co-expression network analysis to identify highly correlated modules in each group. Overall, there was a striking loss of network complexity going from unaffected subjects to nonconverters and thence to converters (applying standard, graph-theoretic metrics). Graph differences were largely driven by proteins regulating tissue remodeling (e.g. blood-brain barrier). In more detail, certain sets of antithetical proteins were highly correlated in unaffected subjects (e.g. SERPINE1 vs MMP9), as expected in homeostasis. However, for particular protein pairs this trend was reversed in converters (e.g. SERPINE1 vs TIMP1, being synthetical inhibitors of remodeling of extracellular matrix and vasculature). Thus, some correlation signals strongly predict impending conversion to a psychotic disorder and directly suggest pharmaceutical targets.","authors":"Clark D. Jeffries; Diana O.

HSP47, α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type I expression levels were measured using real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Fibroblast migration was analyzed using scratch and transwell migration assays. Contractile activity was measured with a collagen gel contraction assay. HSP47 is increased in patients with CRS without nasal polyps. TGF-β1 induced HSP47 expression in nasal fibroblasts. Myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production, which are induced by TGF-β1, were inhibited by siHSP47. We also confirmed that the Smad2/3 signaling pathway is involved in TGF-β1-induced HSP47 expression in nasal fibroblasts. In a functional assay, TGF-β1-enhanced migration and contraction ability were inhibited by HSP47 knockout. Glucocorticoid reversed the stimulatory effects of TGF-β1 on HSP47 expression and ECM production in nasal fibroblasts and ex vivo organ cultures.

{"abstract":"Vertex models are an important class of statistical mechanical system that admit exact solutions and exotic physics. Applications include water ice, ferro- and antiferro-electrics, spin ice and artificial spin ice. Here we show that it is possible to engineer spin ice films with atomic-layer precision down to the monolayer limit. Specific heat measurements show that these films, which have a fundamentally different symmetry to bulk spin ice, realise systems close to the two-dimensional F-model, with exotic phase transitions on topologically-constrained configurational manifolds. Our results show how spin ice thin films can release the celebrated Pauling entropy of spin ice without an anomaly in the specific heat.

{"abstract":"Male infertility is a multifactorial pathological condition affecting approximately 7% of the male population. The genetic landscape of male infertility is highly complex as semen and testis histological phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous, and at least 2,000 genes are involved in spermatogenesis. The highest frequency of known genetic factors contributing to male infertility (25%) is in azoospermia, but the number of identified genetic anomalies in other semen and aetiological categories is constantly growing. Genetic screening is relevant for its diagnostic value, clinical decision making, and appropriate genetic counselling. Anomalies in sex chromosomes have major roles in severe spermatogenic impairment. Autosome-linked gene mutations are mainly involved in central hypogonadism, monomorphic teratozoospermia or asthenozoospermia, congenital obstructive azoospermia, and familial cases of quantitative spermatogenic disturbances. Results from whole-genome association studies suggest a marginal role for common variants as causative factors; however, some of these variants can be important for pharmacogenetic purposes. Results of studies on copy number variations (CNVs) demonstrate a considerably higher CNV load in infertile patients than in normozoospermic men, whereas whole-exome analysis has proved to be a highly successful diagnostic tool in familial cases of male infertility. Despite such efforts, the aetiology of infertility remains unknown in about 40% of patients, and the discovery of novel genetic factors in idiopathic infertility is a major challenge for the field of androgenetics. Large, international, and consortium-based whole-exome and whole-genome studies are the most promising approach for the discovery of the missing genetic aetiology of idiopathic male infertility. Male infertility is a multifactorial pathological condition, and its genetic landscape is highly complex. Here, Krausz and Riera-Escamilla describe our current understanding of the genetics of male infertility and the clinical implications of this knowledge.","authors":"Csilla Krausz; Antoni Riera-Escamilla","keywords":"Genetic testing; Genetics; Male factor infertility; Reproductive techniques","organization_affiliated":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences “Mario Serio”, Centre of Excellence DeNothe, University of Florence, Florence, Italy; Andrology Department, Fundació Puigvert, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas Sant Pau (IIB-Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain; Andrology Department, Fundació Puigvert, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas Sant Pau (IIB-Sant Pau), Barcelona, Spain","title":"Genetics of male infertility","id":"0e2df725-b681-4e0f-b656-3636e9dc6d5a"}
{"abstract":"Coral reefs face many stressors associated with global climate change, including increasing sea surface temperature and ocean acidification. Excavating sponges, such as Cliona spp., are expected to break down reef substrata more quickly as seawater becomes more acidic. However, increased bioerosion requires that Cliona spp. maintain physiological performance and health under continuing ocean warming. In this study, we exposed C. orientalis to temperature increments increasing from 23 to 32 °C. At 32 °C, or 3 °C above the maximum monthly mean (MMM) temperature, sponges bleached and the photosynthetic capacity of Symbiodinium was compromised, consistent with sympatric corals. Cliona orientalis demonstrated little capacity to recover from thermal stress, remaining bleached with reduced Symbiodinium density and energy reserves after one month at reduced temperature. In comparison, C. orientalis was not observed to bleach during the 2017 coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, when temperatures did not reach the 32 °C threshold. While C. orientalis can withstand current temperature extremes (\u003c3 °C above MMM) under laboratory and natural conditions, this species would not survive ocean temperatures projected for 2100 without acclimatisation or adaptation (≥3 °C above MMM). Hence, as ocean temperatures increase above local thermal thresholds, C. orientalis will have a negligible impact on reef erosion.","authors":"Blake D. Ramsby; Mia O. Hoogenboom; Hillary A.

{"abstract":"Multigene expression signatures provide a molecular subdivision of early breast cancer associated with patient outcome. A gap remains in the validation of such signatures in clinical treatment groups of patients within population-based cohorts of unselected primary breast cancer representing contemporary disease stages and current treatments. A cohort of 3520 resectable breast cancers with RNA sequencing data included in the population-based SCAN-B initiative (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02306096) were selected from a healthcare background population of 8587 patients diagnosed within the years 2010–2015. RNA profiles were classified according to 19 reported gene signatures including both gene expression subtypes (e.g. PAM50, IC10, CIT) and risk predictors (e.g. Oncotype DX, 70-gene, ROR). Classifications were analyzed in nine adjuvant clinical assessment groups: TNBC-ACT (adjuvant chemotherapy, n = 239), TNBC-untreated (n = 82), HER2+/ER− with anti-HER2+ ACT treatment (n = 110), HER2+/ER+ with anti-HER2 + ACT + endocrine treatment (n = 239), ER+/HER2−/LN− with endocrine treatment (n = 1113), ER+/HER2−/LN− with endocrine + ACT treatment (n = 243), ER+/HER2−/LN+ with endocrine treatment (n = 423), ER+/HER2−/LN+ with endocrine + ACT treatment (n = 433), and ER+/HER2−/LN− untreated (n = 200). Gene signature classification (e.g., proportion low-, high-risk) was generally well aligned with stratification based on current immunohistochemistry-based clinical practice. Most signatures did not provide any further risk stratification in TNBC and HER2+/ER– disease. Risk classifier agreement (low-, medium/intermediate-, high-risk groups) in ER+ assessment groups was on average 50–60% with occasional pair-wise comparisons having \u003c30% agreement. Disregarding the intermediate-risk groups, the exact agreement between low- and high-risk groups was on average ~80–95%, for risk prediction signatures across all assessment groups. Outcome analyses were restricted to assessment groups of TNBC-ACT and endocrine treated ER+/HER2−/LN− and ER+/HER2−/LN+ cases. For ER+/HER2− disease, gene signatures appear to contribute additional prognostic value even at a relatively short follow-up time. Less apparent prognostic value was observed in the other groups for the tested signatures. The current study supports the usage of gene expression signatures in specific clinical treatment groups within population-based breast cancer. It also stresses the need of further development to reach higher consensus in individual patient classifications, especially for intermediate-risk patients, and the targeting of patients where current gene signatures and prognostic variables provide little support in clinical decision-making.","authors":"Johan Vallon-Christersson; Jari Häkkinen; Cecilia Hegardt; Lao H.

{"abstract":"Night shift work is associated with cardiovascular disease and central nervous system disorders in female nurses. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exerts protective effects on neural and endothelial functions. This study examined the association between serum BDNF levels and pulse pressure after rest in female nurses working night shifts. In this study, blood samples were collected for BDNF measurement after a night shift when nurses had been working night shifts for three continuous weeks. Blood pressure was assessed before and after a one-hour morning rest within a week of resuming the night shift after one month without any night shift work. The pulse pressure of nurses (n = 48, age 29 ± 5 years) was significantly reduced (from 43 ± 7 to 41 ± 6 mmHg, P = 0.003) after rest, and serum BDNF were significantly and inversely correlated with pulse pressure changes (r = −0.435, P = 0.002). Higher serum BDNF was an independent factor for greater reduction in pulse pressure (95%CI = −0.609 ‒ −0.174, P = 0.001). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, serum BDNF \u003e20.6 ng/mL predicted a pulse pressure reduction after a one-hour rest (sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 77.8%). In conclusion, higher serum BDNF predicted greater recovery of pulse pressure after a one-hour rest in female nurses after night shift work.","authors":"I-Te Lee; Wayne Huey-Herng Sheu; Wen-Jane Lee; Der-Yuan Chen","keywords":"Metabolic syndrome; Predictive markers","organization_affiliated":"Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; PhD Program in Translational Medicine and Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan","title":"Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor predicting reduction in pulse pressure after a one-hour rest in nurses working night shifts","id":"b93f9128-d28b-408c-89c0-6d4977233378"}
{"abstract":"Years with high fruit production, known as mast years, are the usual reproduction strategy of European beech. Harsh weather conditions such as frost during flowering can lead to pollination failure in spring. It has been assumed that mast is controlled by flowering, and that after successful pollination, high amounts of fruits and seeds would be produced. However, the extremely hot and dry European summer of 2018 showed that despite successful pollination, beechnuts did not develop or were only abundant in a few forest stands. An in-depth analysis of three forest sites of European beech from the Swiss Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme over the last 15–19 years revealed for the first time that extreme summer heat and drought can act as an “environmental veto”, leading to early fruit abortion. Within the forest stands in years with fruit abortion, summer mean temperatures were 1.5 °C higher and precipitation sums were 45% lower than the long-term average. Extreme summer heat and drought, together with frost during flowering, are therefore disrupting events of the assumed biennial fruiting cycle in European beech.","authors":"Anita Nussbaumer; Katrin Meusburger; Maria Schmitt; Peter Waldner; Regula Gehrig; Matthias Haeni; Andreas Rigling; Ivano Brunner; Anne Thimonier","keywords":"Drought; Forest ecology; Forestry; Fruiting","organization_affiliated":"Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss, Zurich-Flughafen, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","title":"Extreme summer heat and drought lead to early fruit abortion in European beech","id":"e6b63411-861c-4ee2-bacc-8e7e208cff7f"}
{"abstract":"Approximately 10–20% of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) fail to respond to steroid therapy. NS is divided into steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS). Over 45 recessive and dominant genes have been found to be associated with SRNS and/or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Targeted sequencing of 339 candidate genes, expressed in glomerular filtration barrier or located in the signaling pathway of podocyte function, were sequenced by NGS in a cohort of total 89 Chinese Han children (29 sporadic SRNS, 33 sporadic SSNS, and 27 healthy). Two variants (WT1 p.R441X and NPHS2 p.G149V) were screened out as pathogenic mutations and 14 variants were likely pathogenic. Mutations of KIRREL2 (SRNS vs SSNS: 24.1% vs 3.0%, adjusted OR = 10.11, 95% CI: 1.56–198.66, P = 0.039) were significantly associated with the risk of pediatric sporadic SRNS. Besides, three pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in HP gene. Two pathogenic mutations and 14 likely pathogenic mutations were discovered through targeted sequencing of 339 candidate genes. Two genes, HP and KIRREL2, as candidate genes, were first proposed to be associated with the risk of pediatric sporadic SRNS.","authors":"Jianguo Li; Lijun Wang; Ling Wan; Tiantian Lin; Wentao Zhao; Hang Cui; Huarong Li; Li Cao; Jianxin Wu; Ting Zhang","keywords":"Medicine/Public Health, general; Pediatrics; Pediatric Surgery","organization_affiliated":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; The Intensive Care Unit 2, Children’s Hospital of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, China; Department of Nephrology, Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; Department of Nephrology, Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; Vishuo MedTech Ltd, Beijing, China; Vishuo MedTech Ltd, Beijing, China; Department of Nephrology, Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; Department of Nephrology, Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; Department of Biochemistry, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China; Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China","title":"Mutational spectrum and novel candidate genes in Chinese children with sporadic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome","id":"c150007e-e0ba-43e6-a565-76833949ed7c"}
{"abstract":"Individual-based models, ‘IBMs’, describe naturally the dynamics of interacting organisms or social or financial agents. They are considered too complex for mathematical analysis, but computer simulations of them cannot give the general insights required. Here, we resolve this problem with a general mathematical framework for IBMs containing interactions of an unlimited level of complexity, and derive equations that reliably approximate the effects of space and stochasticity. We provide software, specified in an accessible and intuitive graphical way, so any researcher can obtain analytical and simulation results for any particular IBM without algebraic manipulation. We illustrate the framework with examples from movement ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary ecology. This framework will provide unprecedented insights into a hitherto intractable panoply of complex models across many scientific fields. Individual-based models are widely used to simulate complex systems of interacting agents. Here the authors provide a mathematical framework that automates the analysis of any model in a wide class, facilitating a deeper understanding of the scientific questions these models are used to address.","authors":"Stephen J.

{"abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity and are highly expressed during sepsis. Thus, studying the expression of TLRs in an animal septic model might indicate their possible association with acute kidney injury in sepsis. Seventy-two male C57BL/6J mice were used for this study. Randomly, these animals were divided into 6 groups (N = 12/group): 3 control and 3 septic groups depending on the euthanasia time (24 h, 48 h, 72 h). Septic groups underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce peritonitis, while control groups had a sham operation. Hematological tests were performed in serum for immune biomarkers; immunohistochemistry, morphometry and qRT-PCR analysis were used on both kidney and intestine tissues to evaluate the expression of TLR 2, 3, 4 and 7 in a septic process. At the end of each experimental period, we found that TLRs 2, 3, 4 and 7 were expressed in both tissues but there were differences between those at various time points. Also, we found that mRNA levels were significantly higher in qRT-PCR evaluation in septic groups than control groups in both kidney and intestinal tissues (p \u003c 0.05); showing a steady increase in the septic groups as the time to euthanasia was prolonged (p \u003c 0.05). Overall, our study provides a suggestion that TLRs 2, 3, 4 and 7 are highly expressed in the kidneys of septic mice and especially that these TLRs are sensitive and specific markers for sepsis. Finally, our study supports the diagnostic importance of TLRs in AKI and provides an insight on the contribution of septic mice models in the study of multi organ dysfunction syndrome in general.","authors":"Sylvia Krivan; Alkistis Kapelouzou; Stylianos Vagios; Diamantis I.

{"abstract":"Histamine is a widely distributed biogenic amine involved in the regulation of an array of biological processes. Serum histamine level is markedly elevated in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction, whereas the role it plays remains unclear. Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the unique enzyme responsible for histamine production, and cardiac injury is significantly aggravated in HDC knockout mice (HDC−/−), in which histamine is deficient. We also observed that autophagy was highly activated in cardiomyocytes of HDC−/− mice post acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which was abolished by compensation of exogenous histamine. The in vivo and in vitro results showed that acting through histamine 1 receptor, histamine increased miR-206 and miR-216b, which worked in concert to target to Atg13, resulting in the reduction of autophagy activation under hypoxia and AMI condition. Further study revealed that Atg13 interacted with FADD to promote the activation of caspase-8 and cell apoptosis. Taken together, these data unveil a novel intracellular signaling pathway involved in histamine regulating myocardial autophagy and apoptosis under hypoxia and AMI condition, which might help to more comprehensively evaluate the usage of histamine receptor antagonists and to develop new therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction.","authors":"Suling Ding; Mieradilijiang Abudupataer; Zheliang Zhou; Jinmiao Chen; Hui Li; Lili Xu; Weiwei Zhang; Shuning Zhang; Yunzeng Zou; Tao Hong; Timothy C.

{"abstract":"Aging-associated decrease in internal anal sphincter (IAS) tone (AADI) is a major contributor in the rectoanal incontinence (RI). To determine the pathogenesis of AADI, we investigated the effect of aging on GPCR activation and related downstream signaling. We particularly investigated two GPCRs that characterize IAS smooth muscle cells (SMCs): thromboxane A2 and angiotensin II type 1. Two groups of Fischer 344 rats (6-month-old [young group] and 26-month-old [old group]) were employed to determine the GPCR function by isometric contraction, the expressions of GPCRs, and their downstream regulatory signaling proteins (regulator of G-protein signaling 2, RGS2; GPCR Kinase 5, GRK5; and β-arrestin, Arrb2) using RT-PCR, qPCR, and western blot analyses. We used reversible biotinylation to monitor the GPCR trafficking using SMCs. Aging selectively attenuated thromboxane A2 and Ang II-induced IAS contraction. RT-PCR, qPCR, and WB data revealed a significant decrease in the expressions of the GPCRs and increase in the expression of RGS2, GRK5, and Arrb2. The increased GPCR internalization and decreased recycling under aging were validated by reversible biotinylation. We conclude that downregulation of GPCR, accompanied by upregulation of regulatory proteins, plays an important role in receptor desensitization and may be important underlying mechanisms of RI in certain aging patients.","authors":"Ipsita Mohanty; Jagmohan Singh; Satish Rattan","keywords":"Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal diseases","organization_affiliated":"Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology \u0026 Hepatology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology \u0026 Hepatology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology \u0026 Hepatology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA","title":"Downregulation of thromboxane A2 and angiotensin II type 1 receptors associated with aging-related decrease in internal anal sphincter tone","id":"cf0cb089-9178-4110-9359-7346de459b7b"}

{"abstract":"The application of fluorescent proteins in ornamental plants has lagged behind despite the recent development of powerful genetic tools. Although we previously generated transgenic torenia plants expressing green fluorescent protein from marine plankton (CpYGFP), in which bright fluorescence was easily visible at the whole plant level, the maximum excitation of this protein within the visible light spectrum required the use of a coloured emission filter to eliminate exciting light. Here, to overcome this limitation, we generated transgenic petunia plants expressing eYGFPuv, a CpYGFP derivative exhibiting bright fluorescence under invisible ultraviolet (UV) light excitation, with a novel combination of transcriptional terminator plus translational enhancer. As expected, all transgenic plants exhibited brilliant green fluorescence easily visible to the naked eye without an emission filter. In addition, fluorescence expressed in transgenic petunia flowers was stable during long-term vegetative propagation. Finally, we visually and quantitatively confirmed that transgenic petunia flowers resist to long-term exposure of UV without any damages such as fluorescence decay and withering. Thus, our whole-plant fluorescence imaging tool, that does not require high sensitive imaging equipment or special imaging conditions for observation, might be useful not only for basic plant research but also for ornamental purposes as a novel flower property.","authors":"Dong Poh Chin; Ikuo Shiratori; Akihisa Shimizu; Ko Kato; Masahiro Mii; Iwao Waga","keywords":"Molecular engineering in plants","organization_affiliated":"Center for Environment, Health and Field Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Innovation Laboratories, NEC Solution Innovators, Ltd., 1-18-7, Shinkiba, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Innovation Laboratories, NEC Solution Innovators, Ltd., 1-18-7, Shinkiba, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan; Center for Environment, Health and Field Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Innovation Laboratories, NEC Solution Innovators, Ltd., 1-18-7, Shinkiba, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan","title":"Generation of brilliant green fluorescent petunia plants by using a new and potent fluorescent protein transgene","id":"4d3396d5-4162-4fa2-8880-7ec87a518468"}
{"abstract":"We tested the hypothesis that environmental trophic conditions prominent during the growing period (nurture conditions) can modify the differing physiological profiles between fast (F)- and slow (S)-growing juveniles of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Approximately 200 individuals were fed a high organic content diet dosed below the pseudofaeces threshold (BP), whereas another 200 were fed a low organic content diet dosed above the pseudofaeces threshold (AP), forcing them to maintain a continuous production of pseudofaeces. After 3 months, F and S individuals in each rearing condition were selected and used in feeding experiments. We measured the physiological parameters of the energy balance of selected F and S mussels fed on 4 different diets and tested the effects of the rearing condition (BP vs AP) and growth condition (F vs S) upon the physiological variables. Irrespective of the rearing condition, F-mussels attained higher values of scope for growth with the four experimental diets due to their capacity to display higher clearance rates and preingestive selection efficiencies. F-individuals also had higher gill-surface areas than S individuals. We discussed the role of the gills in determining inter-individual growth rate differences in the mussel.","authors":"D.

{"abstract":"It is essential for the survival and reproduction of parasitoids to adapt to the fluctuating host resources. Phenotypic plasticity may enable a parasitoid species to successfully achieve its control over a range of host species to maximize fitness in different hosts that may each require dissimilar, possibly conflicting, specific adaptations. However, there is limited information on how the fitness effects of host switching partition into costs due to the novelty of host species, where unfamiliarity with host physiological and morphological changes and its anti-parasite defenses reduces parasitoid growth, survivorship and/or reproductive success. In this study, the parasitoid fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato was found to sympatrically infect a principal host ant species and other alternative sympatric hosts in the forest of central Taiwan. We herein report that the occurrence of ant infections by O. unilateralis s.l. shows spatial and temporal variation patterns on different host species. Results showed that the height from the ground to the leaf where the infected ants grip on, perithecia-forming ability, and growth rate of the stroma of the parasitoid fungus were dissimilar on different host species. These host range expansions not only related the fitness of O. unilateralis s.l. but also influenced the expression of extended phenotypic traits. Our findings revealed that a generalist parasitoid fungus suffered an evolutionary tradeoff between host breadth expansion and host-use efficiency.","authors":"Wei-Jiun Lin; Yung-I Lee; Shao-Lun Liu; Chung-Chi Lin; Tan-Ya Chung; Jui-Yu Chou","keywords":"Fungal ecology; Microbial ecology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biology, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan; Biology Department, National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Life Science \u0026 Center for Ecology and Environment, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Biology, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan; Department of Biology, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan; Department of Biology, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan","title":"Evaluating the tradeoffs of a generalist parasitoid fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis , on different sympatric ant hosts","id":"562c6cf0-cff3-4d4d-bdc3-3a0bf70e8574"}
{"abstract":"Inadequate reporting in nutritional epidemiology study has important downstream consequences for the public and the reputation of the nutrition research. Poor reporting of nutritional studies can have serious implications on knowledge transfer, public health policy, and research. In addition, it is a significant and avoidable source of research waste. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-nutritional epidemiology (STROBE-nut) statement comprises a set of 24 items, organised as a checklist, with minimal information to be included in manuscripts describing findings of nutritional epidemiology research and dietary assessment. The goal of STROBE-nut is to ensure all information is available to enable quality appraisal, correct understanding, effective replication and application of findings. It has been suggested that robust implementation of reporting guidelines will translate into more complete reported research. Furthermore systematic use of reporting guidelines can indirectly improve the methodological qualities of research papers. In this regard, if STROBE-nut becomes a common practice between the community of nutritionist and epidemiologist, it can enhance the quality of the nutritional epidemiology field output. We thus suggest the endorsement of STROBE-nut at the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.","authors":"Carl Lachat; Dana Hawwash","keywords":"Epidemiology; Medical research","organization_affiliated":"Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium","title":"The addition of STROBE-nut to the EJCN instructions to authors: some considerations and caveats","id":"7be00cd5-a8fd-46f7-b9dd-5c00420216d3"}
{"abstract":"The intestinal epithelium is a structured organ composed of crypts harboring Lgr5+ stem cells, and villi harboring differentiated cells. Spatial transcriptomics have demonstrated profound zonation of epithelial gene expression along the villus axis, but the mechanisms shaping this spatial variability are unknown. Here, we combine laser capture micro-dissection and single cell RNA sequencing to uncover spatially zonated populations of mesenchymal cells along the crypt-villus axis. These include villus tip telocytes (VTTs) that express Lgr5, a gene previously considered a specific crypt epithelial stem cell marker. VTTs are elongated cells that line the villus tip epithelium and signal through Bmp morphogens and the non-canonical Wnt5a ligand. Their ablation is associated with perturbed zonation of enterocyte genes induced at the villus tip. Our study provides a spatially-resolved cell atlas of the small intestinal stroma and exposes Lgr5+ villus tip telocytes as regulators of the epithelial spatial expression programs along the villus axis. Epithelial gene expression has been shown to be zonated along the crypt-villus axis, but mechanisms shaping this spatial variability were unknown.

{"abstract":"What makes us willing to sacrifice our own self-interest for another person? Humans can forgo short-term individual gain to achieve long-term benefits1–4—but long-run self-interest cannot fully explain unselfish behaviour5. Collaboration in our evolutionary past may have played a role in shaping an innate human sense of distributive justice6, influencing who we consider deserving of our aid or generosity. Previous research has not been able to isolate this response to collaboration as an independent effect, distinct from other motivations to share7,8. Here we present evidence of a pure collaboration effect, distinct from motivations of future reciprocity, in-group favouritism or concern for accountability. We demonstrate this effect among adult subjects in an economic setting, showing that the effect constitutes a psychological phenomenon with relevance for real-world social and political behaviour. This collaboration effect is substantial: it motivates sharing among people otherwise inclined to share nothing and increases the proportion of participants willing to give up half of their allotted money. We find evidence supporting our hypothesis that the collaboration effect operates by creating a sense of debt owed to one’s collaborator. What conditions produce a willingness to sacrifice our own self-interest for others? McGrath and Gerber find that collaboration increases willingness to sacrifice, distinct from considerations of accountability, in-group favouritism or disparity.","authors":"Mary C. McGrath; Alan S.

{"abstract":" Protein ubiquitylation has important regulatory functions, influencing protein–protein interactions and protein stability. The final step of ubiquitylation is catalysed by ubiquitin ligases (E3s), a diverse group of proteins that operate with distinct mechanisms. Recent structural data have provided insights into these mechanisms, extending our understanding of E3 function and regulation. Covalent attachment (conjugation) of one or more ubiquitin molecules to protein substrates governs numerous eukaryotic cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell division and immune responses. Ubiquitylation was originally associated with protein degradation, but it is now clear that ubiquitylation also mediates processes such as protein–protein interactions and cell signalling depending on the type of ubiquitin conjugation. Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) catalyse the final step of ubiquitin conjugation by transferring ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) to substrates. In humans, more than 600 E3s contribute to determining the fates of thousands of substrates; hence, E3s need to be tightly regulated to ensure accurate substrate ubiquitylation. Recent findings illustrate how E3s function on a structural level and how they coordinate with E2s and substrates to meticulously conjugate ubiquitin. Insights regarding the mechanisms of E3 regulation, including structural aspects of their autoinhibition and activation are also emerging.","authors":"Lori Buetow; Danny T.

{"abstract":"Asymptomatic brain abnormalities are common incidental findings on brain MRI in the elderly population and can be regarded as imaging markers of early stroke and dementia. We initiated the Taizhou Imaging Study (TIS) to examine the prevalence and correlates of incidental findings using brain MRI among an elderly population residing in a rural area of China. A total of 562 individuals, at the age of 55 to 65 years, participated in the TIS study with a response rate of 90%. The prevalence of lacunes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), perivascular space, and intracranial arterial stenosis was 26.69%, 10.68%, 18.51%, 27.76%, and 12.81%, respectively. Age and hypertension were the major correlates of these incidental findings. Per each year increase in age, the risks of WMH and CMB increased by 15% and 14%. Compared to individuals with normal blood pressure, individuals with hypertension had an increased risk of all incidental findings, with the adjusted odds ratios of 2.28 to 5.45. Correlations of age, gender and body mass index with brain gray matter fraction were also observed. The high prevalence of these findings indicates a need of preventative strategy to help prevent future stroke and dementia in this population.","authors":"Shuyuan Li; Fang Fang; Mei Cui; Yanfeng Jiang; Yingzhe Wang; Xuhui Kong; Weizhong Tian; Min Fan; Ziyu Yuan; Jinhua Chen; Qi Yang; Fuzhong Xue; Jiucun Wang; Ming Lu; Xiaofeng Wang; Xingdong Chen; Li Jin; Weimin Ye","keywords":"Cerebrovascular disorders; Epidemiology","organization_affiliated":"International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Institute of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Taizhou People’s Hospital, Taizhou, China; Taizhou People’s Hospital, Taizhou, China; Taixing Disease Control and Prevention Center, Taizhou, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; Taizhou People’s Hospital, Taizhou, China; Institute of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Ji’nan, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji’nan, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Fudan University Taizhou Institute of Health Sciences, Taizhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","title":"Incidental findings on brain MRI among Chinese at the age of 55–65 years: the Taizhou Imaging Study","id":"6b42bb6e-6a91-4b91-a7ad-cb2bc245272d"}
{"abstract":"Ovarian cancer has a high death rate and is often not detected until late stages. While some studies found high expressions of MMPs correlated with cancer invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis, however, several other studies indicated MMPs might inhibit cancer rather than promote cancer in certain situations. Thus, the role of different MMPs in different cancer types needs a systematic re-evaluation. In this study, we used RNA-Seq and corresponding clinical data downloaded from TCGA and analyzed the correlations between MMP expressions and the clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC) patients. Among the MMPs investigated, MMP-3 was significantly increased in high-grade and high-stage tumors compared with low-grade and low-stage ones. Using univariate analysis and multivariate Cox model, high expressions of MMP-19 and -20 were found to associate with poor overall survival independent of clinicopathologic characteristics. Moreover, using in vitro studies, we found ovarian cancer cell lines with higher MMP-19 and -20 protein expressing levels were associated with anti-cancer drugs resistance, while knockdown of MMP-19 or -20 increased ovarian cancer cell sensitivities to several clinical using chemotherapy agents. Finally, knockdown of MMP-19 or -20 also decreased the invasion abilities of several ovarian cancer cell lines. These in vitro studies provided potential mechanisms of high MMP-19 and -20 expressions in the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer.","authors":"Shujie Wang; Jia Jia; Dongyan Liu; Meng Wang; Zhen Wang; Xueling Li; Hongzhi Wang; Yong Rui; Zhirong Liu; Wei Guo; Jinfu Nie; Haiming Dai","keywords":"Cancer; Computational biology and bioinformatics","organization_affiliated":"Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology, Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China; Hefei Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China","title":"Matrix Metalloproteinase Expressions Play Important role in Prediction of Ovarian Cancer Outcome","id":"fe84f75b-0609-427c-82a2-9067e43d21ff"}
{"abstract":"Dimensions and surface properties are the predominant factors for the applications of nanofluidic devices. Here we use a thin liquid film as a nanochannel by inserting a gas bubble in a glass capillary, a technique we name bubble-based film nanofluidics. The height of the film nanochannel can be regulated by the Debye length and wettability, while the length independently changed by applied pressure. The film nanochannel behaves functionally identically to classical solid state nanochannels, as ion concentration polarizations. Furthermore, the film nanochannels can be used for label-free immunosensing, by principle of wettability change at the solid interface. The optimal sensitivity for the biotin-streptavidin reaction is two orders of magnitude higher than for the solid state nanochannel, suitable for a full range of electrolyte concentrations. We believe that the film nanochannel represents a class of nanofluidic devices that is of interest for fundamental studies and also can be widely applied, due to its reconfigurable dimensions, low cost, ease of fabrication and multiphase interfaces. Dimensions and the surface properties of the nanochannels are vital to the functions and applications of nano-fluidic devices.

{"abstract":"The fact that organic solar cells perform efficiently despite the low dielectric constant of most photoactive blends initiated a long-standing debate regarding the dominant pathways of free charge formation. Here, we address this issue through the accurate measurement of the activation energy for free charge photogeneration over a wide range of photon energy, using the method of time-delayed collection field. For our prototypical low bandgap polymer:fullerene blends, we find that neither the temperature nor the field dependence of free charge generation depend on the excitation energy, ruling out an appreciable contribution to free charge generation though hot carrier pathways. On the other hand, activation energies are on the order of the room temperature thermal energy for all studied blends. We conclude that charge generation in such devices proceeds through thermalized charge transfer states, and that thermal energy is sufficient to separate most of these states into free charges. Contradictory models are being debated on the dominant pathways of charge generation in organic solar cells. Here Kurpiers et al. determine the activation energy for this fundamental process and reveal that the main channel is via thermalized charge transfer states instead of hot exciton dissociation.","authors":"Jona Kurpiers; Thomas Ferron; Steffen Roland; Marius Jakoby; Tobias Thiede; Frank Jaiser; Steve Albrecht; Silvia Janietz; Brian A.

Thus, there is an urgent need for standardization of the entire process of fecal transplant production. This study provides a complete standardized procedure to prepare and store live and ready-to-use transplants that meet the standard requirements of good practices to applied use in pharmaceutical industry. We show that, if time before transformation to transplants would exceed 24 hours, fresh samples should not be exposed to temperatures above 20 °C, and refrigeration at 4 °C can be a safe solution. Oxygen-free atmosphere was not necessary and simply removing air above collected samples was sufficient to preserve viability. Transplants prepared in maltodextrin-trehalose solutions, stored in a -80 °C standard freezer and then rapidly thawed at 37 °C, retained the best revivification potential as  proven by 16S rRNA profiles, metabolomic fingerprints, and flow cytometry assays over a 3-month observation period.

{"abstract":"In support of the visual stream dissociation hypothesis, which states that distinct visual streams serve vision-for-perception and vision-for-action, visual size illusions were reported over 20 years ago to ‘deceive the eye but not the hand’. Ever since, inconclusive results and contradictory interpretations have accumulated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the Ebbinghaus figure on repetitive aiming movements with distinct dynamics. Participants performed a Fitts’ task in which Ebbinghaus figures served as targets. We systematically varied the three parameters which have been shown to influence the perceived size of the Ebbinghaus figure’s target circle, namely the size of the target, its distance to the context circles and the size of the context circles. This paper shows that movement is significantly affected by the context size, but, in contrast to perception, not by the other two parameters. This is especially prominent in the approach phase of the movement towards the target, regardless of the dynamics. To reconcile the findings, we argue that different informational variables are used for size perception and the visual control of movements irrespective of whether certain variables induce (perceptual) illusions.","authors":"Hester Knol; Raoul Huys; Jean-Christophe Sarrazin; Andreas Spiegler; Viktor K.

{"abstract":"Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep without atonia (RSWA), a marker of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), is frequently comorbid with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although rodent models are commonly used for studying PD, the neurobiological and behavioral correlates of RBD remain poorly understood. Therefore, we developed a behavior-based criteria to identify RSWA in the hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. Video recordings of rats were analyzed, to develop a criteria consisting of behavioral signs that occurred during polysomnographically confirmed epochs of sleep-wake stages. The sleep-slouch, a postural shift of the body or head caused only by gravity, was identified as a unique behavioral sign of REM sleep onset and was altered in hemiparkinsonian rats during RSWA. There was a significant correlation between the behavior-based criteria and polysomnograms for all sleep-wake stages in control but not hemiparkinsonian rats indicating a deterioration of sleep-wake architecture in parkinsonism. We then tested the efficacy of levodopa in ameliorating RSWA using intermittent and around-the-clock (ATC) dosing regimens. ATC levodopa dosing at 4 mg/kg for 48 h caused a significant reduction of RSWA as measured by polysomnography and the behavioral-based criteria along with an amelioration of forelimb motor deficits. Our findings show that the phenomenological correlates of RSWA can be reliably characterized in the hemiparkinsonian rat model. ATC levodopa administration ameliorates RSWA in this model without deleterious consequences to the overall sleep-wake architecture and therapeutic benefits for parkinsonian motor deficits. These findings suggest that further study may allow for the application of a similar approach to treat RBD in PD patients.","authors":"Vishakh Iyer; Quynh Vo; Anthony Mell; Siven Chinniah; Ashley Zenerovitz; Kala Venkiteswaran; Allen R.

{"abstract":"G protein αs (GNAS) mediates receptor-stimulated cAMP signalling, which integrates diverse environmental cues with intracellular responses. GNAS is mutationally activated in multiple tumour types, although its oncogenic mechanisms remain elusive. We explored this question in pancreatic tumourigenesis where concurrent GNAS and KRAS mutations characterize pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). By developing genetically engineered mouse models, we show that GnasR201C cooperates with KrasG12D to promote initiation of IPMN, which progress to invasive PDA following Tp53 loss. Mutant Gnas remains critical for tumour maintenance in vivo. This is driven by protein-kinase-A-mediated suppression of salt-inducible kinases (Sik1–3), associated with induction of lipid remodelling and fatty acid oxidation. Comparison of Kras-mutant pancreatic cancer cells with and without Gnas mutations reveals striking differences in the functions of this network. Thus, we uncover Gnas-driven oncogenic mechanisms, identify Siks as potent tumour suppressors, and demonstrate unanticipated metabolic heterogeneity among Kras-mutant pancreatic neoplasms. Bardeesy and colleagues show that mutant GNAS suppresses salt-inducible kinases by activating PKA, leading to lipid remodelling and pancreatic tumourigenesis","authors":"Krushna C.

{"abstract":"The present work introduces a good prospect for the development of hierarchical catalysts with excellent catalytic performance in the methanol to aromatic hydrocarbons conversion (MTA) process. Hierarchical H-ZSM5 zeolites, with a tailored pore size and different Si/Al ratios, were synthesized directly using natural kaolin clay as a low-cost silica and aluminium resource. Further explored for the direct synthesis of hierarchical HZSM-5 structures was the steam assisted conversion (SAC) with a cost-effective and green affordable saccharide source of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), as a secondary mesopore agent. The fabricated zeolites exhibiting good crystallinity, 2D and 3D nanostructures, high specific surface area, tailored pore size, and tunable acidity. Finally, the catalyst performance in the conversion of methanol to aromatic hydrocarbons was tested in a fixed bed reactor.

{"abstract":"The Early Cretaceous basal birds were known largely from just two-dimensionally preserved specimens from north-eastern China (Jehol Biota), which has hindered our understanding of the early evolution of birds. Here, we present a three-dimensionally-preserved skeleton (FPDM-V-9769) of a basal bird from the Early Cretaceous of Fukui, central Japan. Unique features in the pygostyle and humerus allow the assignment of FPDM-V-9769 to a new taxon, Fukuipteryx prima. FPDM-V-9769 exhibits a set of features comparable to that of other basalmost birds including Archaeopteryx. Osteohistological analyses indicate that FPDM-V-9769 is subadult. Phylogenetic analyses resolve F. prima as a non-ornithothoracine avialan basal to Jeholornis and outgroup of the Pygostylia. This phylogenetic result may imply a complex evolutionary history of basal birds. To our knowledge, FPDM-V-9769 represents the first record of the Early Cretaceous non-ornithothoracine avialan outside of the Jehol Biota and increases our understanding of their diversity and distribution during the time. A new fossil bird from the Early Cretaceous of Japan provides evidence that the evolutionary history of early birds was more complex than previously realised. This new species also has important implications for the distribution of early birds, demonstrating that they inhabited temperate, lowland regions.","authors":"Takuya Imai; Yoichi Azuma; Soichiro Kawabe; Masateru Shibata; Kazunori Miyata; Min Wang; Zhonghe Zhou","keywords":"Biogeography; Palaeontology","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Dinosaur Research, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji, Japan; Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, Katsuyama, Japan; Institute of Dinosaur Research, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji, Japan; Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, Katsuyama, Japan; Institute of Dinosaur Research, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji, Japan; Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, Katsuyama, Japan; Institute of Dinosaur Research, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji, Japan; Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, Katsuyama, Japan; Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, Katsuyama, Japan; Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","title":"An unusual bird (Theropoda, Avialae) from the Early Cretaceous of Japan suggests complex evolutionary history of basal birds","id":"05acb6f0-0f27-4be8-957b-03cd94da8ec4"}
{"abstract":"A 900 nm thick TiO2 simple cubic photonic crystal with lattice constant 450 nm was fabricated and used to experimentally validate a newly-discovered mechanism for extreme light-bending. Absorption enhancement was observed extending 1–2 orders of magnitude over that of a reference TiO2 film. Several enhancement peaks in the region from 600–950 nm were identified, which far exceed both the ergodic fundamental limit and the limit based on surface-gratings, with some peaks exceeding 100 times enhancement. These results are attributed to radically sharp refraction where the optical path length approaches infinity due to the Poynting vector lying nearly parallel to the photonic crystal interface. The observed phenomena follow directly from the simple cubic symmetry of the photonic crystal, and can be achieved by integrating the light-trapping architecture into the absorbing volume. These results are not dependent on the material used, and can be applied to any future light trapping applications such as phosphor-converted white light generation, water-splitting, or thin-film solar cells, where increased response in areas of weak absorption is desired.","authors":"Brian J.

{"abstract":"The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for the survival and morphogenesis of bacteria1. For decades, it was thought that only class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and related enzymes effected peptidoglycan synthesis. Recently, it was shown that RodA—a member of the unrelated SEDS protein family—also acts as a peptidoglycan polymerase2–4. Not all bacteria require RodA for growth; however, its homologue, FtsW, is a core member of the divisome complex that appears to be universally essential for septal cell wall assembly5,6. FtsW was previously proposed to translocate the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane7,8. Here, we report that purified FtsW polymerizes lipid II into peptidoglycan, but show that its polymerase activity requires complex formation with its partner class B PBP. We further demonstrate that the polymerase activity of FtsW is required for its function in vivo. Thus, our findings establish FtsW as a peptidoglycan polymerase that works with its cognate class B PBP to produce septal peptidoglycan during cell division. Classically, peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis was thought to be mediated solely by class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and related enzymes, a view changed by the identification of RodA as a PG polymerase. Now FtsW is also shown to polymerize PG, in a process that requires complex formation with a partner class B PBP.","authors":"Atsushi Taguchi; Michael A. Welsh; Lindsey S.

{"abstract":"Evidence for the abundant presentation of class II neoantigens by a human B-cell lymphoma. Neoantigens created by cancer somatic mutations can distinguish between malignant and normal cells, but the challenge lies in their personalized identification and verification. Michael Khodadoust et al. provide evidence for the abundant presentation of MHC class II restricted neoantigens in human B cell lymphomas. Using an integrated genomic and proteomic strategy, they find that mutated tumour antigens are derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and that they drive CD4 T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells1,2,3,4,5,6,7. However, the personalized identification and validation of neoantigens remains a major challenge. Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle-cell lymphomas by using an integrated genomic and proteomic strategy that interrogates tumour antigen peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to systematically characterize MHC ligands from 17 patients. Remarkably, all discovered neoantigenic peptides were exclusively derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions. Although we identified MHC presentation of private polymorphic germline alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-immunoglobulin somatically mutated genes. Somatic mutations within the immunoglobulin variable region were almost exclusively presented by MHC class II. We isolated circulating CD4+ T cells specific for immunoglobulin-derived neoantigens and found these cells could mediate killing of autologous lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification, and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumour neoantigens. Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy.","authors":"Michael S. Khodadoust; Niclas Olsson; Lisa E. Wagar; Ole A. W.

{"abstract":"The effect of chemical order in the structural and physicochemical properties of B12N12 [4,6]-fullerene (BNF) isomers was evaluated using density functional theory and molecular dynamic calculations. The feasibility to find stable BNF isomers with atomic arrangement other than the well-known octahedral Th-symmetry was explored. In this study, the number of homonuclear bonds in the modeled nanostructures was used as categorical parameter to describe and quantify the degree of structural order. The BNF without homonuclear bonds was identified as the most energetically favorable isomer. However, a variety of BNF arrays departing from Th-symmetry was determined as stable structures also. The calculated vibrational spectra suggest that isomers with chemical disorder can be identified by infrared spectroscopy. In general, formation of homonuclear bonds is possible meanwhile the entropy of the system increases, but at expense of cohesive energy. It is proposed that formation of phase-segregated regions stablishes an apparent limit to the number of homonuclear bonds in stable B12N12 fullerenes. It was found that formation of homonuclear bonds decreases substantially the chemical hardness of BNF isomers and generates zones with large charge density, which might act as reactive sites. Moreover, chemical disorder endows BNF isomers with a permanent electric dipole moment as large as 3.28 D. The obtained results suggest that by manipulating their chemical order, the interaction of BNF’s with other molecular entities can be controlled, making them potential candidates for drug delivery, catalysis and sensing.","authors":"Alejandro Escobedo-Morales; Lorenzo Tepech-Carrillo; Alejandro Bautista-Hernández; José Humberto Camacho-García; Diego Cortes-Arriagada; Ernesto Chigo-Anota","keywords":"Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes; Computational methods","organization_affiliated":"Facultad de Ingeniería Química, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Av.

{"abstract":"The aim of this pilot study was to test whether mathematical parameters of the vascular morphology of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can be used as biomarkers and to investigate how these parameters change during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Treatment-naive CNV in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was diagnosed in 28 patients. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) (Avanti/FA Optovue) performed before and after anti-VEGF therapy. The OCT-A data sets were exported to an external image processing program and vessel skeletonization was accomplished by means of edge detection. Based on this technique the total vessel length, the number of segments and the fractal dimension (FD) of the CNV were calculated before and after therapy. The results were compared with other clinical parameters such as VA and central retinal thickness (RT). The total vessel length of the CNV was significantly reduced by anti-VEGF-therapy (mean value 652 pixels vs. 397 pixels; p \u003c 0.0001), as well as the number of individual vessel segments of the CNV (mean value 117 vs. 76; p \u003c 0.0001). The FD of the CNV also decreased significant reduction during therapy (mean 1.23 vs. 1.16, p \u003c 0.0001). The changes in these parameters during treatment corresponded with an increase in VA and a reduction in RT. This pilot study demonstrates that the vascular pattern of CNV in AMD can be visualized and described using mathematical parameters of OCT-A. The changes during therapy correlate significantly with established “activity” parameters of CNV, so changes in these parameters (especially FD) may represent additional CNV “activity” biomarkers.","authors":"Henrik Faatz; Marie-Louise Farecki; Kai Rothaus; Frederic Gunnemann; Matthias Gutfleisch; Albrecht Lommatzsch; Daniel Pauleikhoff","keywords":"Biomarkers; Macular degeneration","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Essen–Duisburg, Duisburg, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, St. Franziskus Hospital, Münster, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Essen–Duisburg, Duisburg, Germany","title":"Optical coherence tomography angiography of types 1 and 2 choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration during anti-VEGF therapy: evaluation of a new quantitative method","id":"473fe77e-a401-4fcf-a9bc-0a2850c051ae"}

Here we show that 2H-TaSe2 exhibits a surprisingly strong optical absorption and photoluminescence resulting from inter-band transitions. We use this perfect combination of electrical and optical properties in several optoelectronic applications. We show a sevenfold enhancement in the photoluminescence intensity of otherwise weakly luminescent multi-layer MoS2 through non-radiative resonant energy transfer from TaSe2 transition dipoles. Using a combination of scanning photocurrent and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we also show that the hot electrons generated by light absorption in TaSe2 have a rather long lifetime unlike conventional metals, making TaSe2 an excellent hot electron injector. Finally, we show a vertical TaSe2/MoS2/graphene photodetector demonstrating a responsivity of \u003e10 AW−1 at 0.1 MHz—one of the fastest reported photodetectors using MoS2.

{"abstract":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex psychiatric disorders, with a proposed gene-environment interaction in their etiology. One mechanism that could explain both the genetic and environmental component is oxidative stress. The aim of our study was to investigate the potential role of common polymorphisms in genes for glutathione transferase A1, M1, T1 and P1 in susceptibility to ASD. We also aimed to explore the possible oxidative stress - specific gene-environment interaction, regarding GST polymorphisms, maternal smoking tobacco during pregnancy (TSDP) and the risk of ASD. This case-control study included 113 children with ASD and 114 age and sex-matched controls. The diagnosis was made based on ICD-10 criteria and verified by Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R). We investigated GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genotypes and explored their individual and combined effects in individuals with ASD. Individual effect of GST genotypes was shown for GSTM1 active genotype decreasing the risk of ASD (OR = 0.554, 95%CI: 0.313–0.983, p = 0.044), and for GSTA1 CC genotype, increasing susceptibility to ASD (OR = 4.132, 95%CI: 1.219–14.012, p = 0.023); the significance was lost when genotype-genotype interactions were added into the logistic regression model. The combination of GSTM1 active and GSTT1 active genotype decreased the risk of ASD (OR = 0.126, 95%CI: 0.029–0.547, p = 0.006), as well as combination of GSTT1 active and GSTP1 llelle (OR = 0.170, 95%CI: 0.029–0.992, p = 0.049). Increased risk of ASD was observed if combination of GSTM1 active and GSTP1 llelle was present (OR = 11.088, 95%CI: 1.745–70.456, p = 0.011). The effect of TSDP was not significant for the risk of ASD, neither individually, nor in interaction with specific GST genotypes. Specific combination of GST genotypes might be associated with susceptibility to ASD, while it appears that maternal smoking during pregnancy does not increase the risk of ASD.","authors":"Vanja Mandic-Maravic; Vesna Coric; Marija Mitkovic-Voncina; Miroslav Djordjevic; Ana Savic-Radojevic; Marko Ercegovac; Marija Matic; Tatjana Simic; Dusica Lecic-Tosevski; Oliver Toskovic; Tatjana Pekmezovic; Marija Pljesa-Ercegovac; Milica Pejovic-Milovancevic","keywords":"Genetics research; Risk factors","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Mental Health, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Mental Health, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; University Children’s Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Neurology Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Mental Health, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Philosophy, Department of Psychology, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Epidemiology, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Medical and Clinical Biochemistry, Belgrade, Serbia; Institute of Mental Health, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia","title":"Interaction of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and tobacco smoking during pregnancy in susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders","id":"23233b19-3078-47e9-8807-5a78a0e852c7"}
{"abstract":"Origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials have recently drawn increasing attention since their flexible mechanical performance has been greatly enhanced by introducing origami patterns to the thin-shell structures. As a typical origami pattern, the waterbomb tube could be adopted to the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, existing designs predominantly make use of the radial expansion/contraction motion of the structure, thereby limiting its full potential to be explored. Here we report a twist motion of tubular mechanical metamaterials based on waterbomb origami that is previously undiscovered. We demonstrate through a detailed kinematic analysis that the initial twist is a rigid-origami motion if the corresponding row of the tube under twist is fully squeezed with both line and plane symmetry, whereas all the subsequent twist motion requires material deformation. The twist angle per axial strain and its relationship with the geometrical parameters of the tube are revealed. Experimental results show the enhancement in stiffness of the tube with the occurrence of the continuous twist motion. We envisage that this finding could greatly expand the application of the waterbomb tube in the design of origami metamaterials with programmable and tuneable mechanical properties.","authors":"Huijuan Feng; Jiayao Ma; Yan Chen; Zhong You","keywords":"Mechanical engineering; Structure of solids and liquids","organization_affiliated":"Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, UK","title":"Twist of Tubular Mechanical Metamaterials Based on Waterbomb Origami","id":"1292b460-2b52-4587-9fcb-0461bd8d84f3"}
{"abstract":"The c-MYC (MYC) oncoprotein is deregulated in over 50% of cancers, yet regulatory mechanisms controlling MYC remain unclear. To this end, we interrogated the MYC interactome using BioID mass spectrometry (MS) and identified PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) and its regulatory subunit PNUTS (protein phosphatase-1 nuclear-targeting subunit) as MYC interactors. We demonstrate that endogenous MYC and PNUTS interact across multiple cell types and that they co-occupy MYC target gene promoters. Inhibiting PP1 by RNAi or pharmacological inhibition results in MYC hyperphosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues, leading to a decrease in MYC protein levels due to proteasomal degradation through the canonical SCFFBXW7 pathway. MYC hyperphosphorylation can be rescued specifically with exogenous PP1, but not other phosphatases. Hyperphosphorylated MYC retained interaction with its transcriptional partner MAX, but binding to chromatin is significantly compromised. Our work demonstrates that PP1/PNUTS stabilizes chromatin-bound MYC in proliferating cells. Deregulated MYC activity is oncogenic and is deregulated in a large fraction of human cancers. Here the authors find that protein phosphatase 1 and its regulatory subunit PNUTS controls MYC stability and its interaction with chromatin.","authors":"Dharmendra Dingar; William B.

{"abstract":"Newly-emerged and vaccine-mismatched influenza A viruses (IAVs) result in a rapid global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody-mediated immunity. In that case, established CD8+ T-cells can reduce disease severity. However, as mutations occur sporadically within immunogenic IAV-derived T-cell peptides, understanding of T-cell receptor (TCRαβ) cross-reactivity towards IAV variants is needed for a vaccine design. Here, we investigate TCRαβ cross-strain recognition across IAV variants within two immunodominant human IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes, HLA-B*37:01-restricted NP338-346 (B37-NP338) and HLA-A*01:01-restricted NP44-52 (A1-NP44). We find high abundance of cross-reactive TCRαβ clonotypes recognizing distinct IAV variants. Structures of the wild-type and variant peptides revealed preserved conformation of the bound peptides. Structures of a cross-reactive TCR-HLA-B37-NP338 complex suggest that the conserved conformation of the variants underpins TCR cross-reactivity. Overall, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell responses, underpinned by conserved epitope structure, facilitates recognition of distinct IAV variants, thus CD8+ T-cell-targeted vaccines could provide protection across different IAV strains. Mutations within immunological epitope containing regions of influenza A virus can impair the established immune response between influenza strains and could impact rational vaccine design. Here Grant et al. examine the presence, structural impact and cross reactivity of two human immunodominant influenza epitope variants.","authors":"Emma J. Grant; Tracy M. Josephs; Liyen Loh; E.

{"abstract":"Rare earth (RE) elements (scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides) are critical for their role in sustainable energy technologies. Problems with their supply chain have motivated research to improve separations methods to recycle these elements from end of life technology. Toward this goal, we report the synthesis and characterization of the ligand tris[(1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxamido)ethyl]amine, H31·TFA (TFA = trifluoroacetic acid), and complexes 1·RE (RE = La, Nd, Dy). A high-throughput experimentation (HTE) screen was developed to quantitatively determine the precipitation of 1·RE as a function of pH as well as equivalents of H31·TFA. This method rapidly determines optimal conditions for the separation of RE mixtures, while minimizing materials consumption. The HTE-predicted conditions are used to achieve the lab-scale separation of Nd/Dy (SFNd/Dy = 213 ± 34) and La/Nd (SFLa/Nd = 16.2 ± 0.2) mixtures in acidic aqueous media. Rare earth elements are critical components of clean energy technologies, but less than 1% are recycled due to high costs of recovery. Here the authors develop a ligand that selectively precipitates rare earth elements from aqueous media as a function of pH to facilitate the separation of binary rare earth mixtures.","authors":"Joshua J.

{"abstract":"Electrophysiological field potential dynamics have been widely used to investigate brain functions and related psychiatric disorders. Considering recent demand for its applicability to freely moving subjects, especially for animals in a group and socially interacting with each other, here we propose a new method based on a bioluminescent voltage indicator LOTUS-V. Using our fiber-free recording method based on the LOTUS-V, we succeeded in capturing dynamic change of brain activity in freely moving mice. Because LOTUS-V is the ratiometric indicator, motion and head-angle artifacts were not significantly detected. Taking advantage of our method as a fiber-free system, we further succeeded in simultaneously recording from multiple independently-locomotive mice that were freely interacting with one another. Importantly, this enabled us to find that the primary visual cortex, a center of visual processing, was activated during the interaction of mice. This methodology may further facilitate a wide range of studies in neurobiology and psychiatry.","authors":"Shigenori Inagaki; Masakazu Agetsuma; Shinya Ohara; Toshio Iijima; Hideo Yokota; Tetsuichi Wazawa; Yoshiyuki Arai; Takeharu Nagai","keywords":"Bioluminescence imaging; Visual system","organization_affiliated":"Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; Division of Homeostatic Development, Department of Developmental Physiology, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan; Division of Systems Neuroscience, Tohoku University Graduate School of Life Sciences, Sendai, Japan; Division of Systems Neuroscience, Tohoku University Graduate School of Life Sciences, Sendai, Japan; Image Processing Research Team, RIKEN Centre for Advanced Photonics, Saitama, Japan; The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan","title":"Imaging local brain activity of multiple freely moving mice sharing the same environment","id":"22a43086-174d-4179-9478-75f321ae1c1d"}
{"abstract":"Vibrational spectroscopy, comprised of infrared absorption and Raman scattering spectroscopy, is widely used for label-free optical sensing and imaging in various scientific and industrial fields. The two molecular spectroscopy methods are sensitive to different types of vibrations and provide complementary vibrational spectra, but obtaining complete vibrational information with a single spectroscopic device is challenging due to the large wavelength discrepancy between the two methods. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous infrared absorption and Raman scattering spectroscopy that allows us to measure the complete broadband vibrational spectra in the molecular fingerprint region with a single instrument based on an ultrashort pulsed laser. The system is based on dual-modal Fourier-transform spectroscopy enabled by efficient use of nonlinear optical effects. Our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates rapid, broadband and high spectral resolution measurements of complementary spectra of organic liquids for precise and accurate molecular analysis. Generally infrared and Raman spectroscopic methods are needed to study the symmetric and asymmetric molecular vibrational modes.

{"abstract":"Aberrant differentiation, driven by activation of normally silent tissue-specific genes, results in a switch of cell identity and often leads to cancer progression. The underlying genetic and epigenetic events are largely unexplored. Here, we report ectopic activation of the hepatobiliary-, intestinal- and neural-specific gene one cut homeobox 2 (ONECUT2) in various subtypes of lung cancer. ONECUT2 expression was associated with poor prognosis of RAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma. ONECUT2 overexpression promoted the malignant growth and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells in vitro, as well as xenograft tumorigenesis and bone metastases of these cells in vivo. Integrative transcriptomics and epigenomics analyses suggested that ONECUT2 promoted the trans-differentiation of lung cancer cells by preferentially targeting and regulating the activity of bivalent chromatin domains through modulating Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) occupancy. Our findings demonstrate that ONECUT2 is a lineage-specific and context-dependent oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that ONECUT2 is a potential therapeutic target for these tumors.","authors":"Qingyang Ma; Kai Wu; Hui Li; Huichun Li; Yufei Zhu; Guohong Hu; Landian Hu; Xiangyin Kong","keywords":"Cancer epigenetics; Non-small-cell lung cancer","organization_affiliated":"CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","title":"ONECUT2 overexpression promotes RAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma progression","id":"f5c13e0a-3b8f-49d6-add1-4d1e5a00eedb"}

{"abstract":"The El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ‘diversity’ has been considered as a major factor limiting its predictability, a critical need for disaster mitigation associated with the trademark climatic swings of the ENSO. Improving climate models for ENSO forecasts relies on deeper understanding of the ENSO diversity but currently at a nascent stage. Here, we show that the ENSO diversity thought previously as ‘complex,’ arises largely as varied contributions from three leading modes of the ENSO to a given event. The ENSO ‘slow manifold’ can be fully described by three leading predictable modes, a quasi-quadrennial mode (QQD), a quasi-biennial (QB) mode and a decadal modulation of the quasi-biennial (DQB). The modal description of ENSO provides a framework for understanding the predictability of and global teleconnections with the ENSO. We further demonstrate it to be a useful framework for understanding biases of climate models in simulating and predicting the ENSO. Therefore, skillful prediction of all shades of ENSO depends critically on the coupled models’ ability to simulate the three modes with fidelity, providing basis for optimism for future of ENSO forecasts.","authors":"Rajib Chattopadhyay; Shivsai Ajit Dixit; B.

{"abstract":"There is currently a lack of experimental evidence for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms in the human gut microbiota. The aim of this study was therefore to experimentally determine the HGT potential in the microbiota of a healthy preterm infant twin pair and to evaluate the global occurrence of the mobilized elements. Stool samples were collected. Both shotgun metagenome sequencing and bacterial culturing were done for the same samples. A range of experimental conditions were used to test DNA transfer for the cultured isolates. Searches for global distribution of transferable elements were done for the ~120,000 metagenomic samples in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. DNA transfer experiments demonstrated frequent transmission of an ESBL encoding IncI1 plasmid, a high copy number ColEI plasmid, and bacteriophage P1. Both IncI1 and ColE1 were abundant in the stool samples. In vitro competition experiments showed that transconjugants containing IncI1 plasmids outcompeted the recipient strain in the absence of antibiotic selection. The SRA searches indicated a global distribution of the mobilizable elements, with chicken identified as a possible reservoir for the IncI1 ESBL encoding plasmid. Our results experimentally support a major horizontal transmission and persistence potential of the preterm infant gut microbiota mobilome involving genes encoding ESBL.","authors":"Mari Hagbø; Anuradha Ravi; Inga Leena Angell; Marianne Sunde; Jane Ludvigsen; Dzung B.

{"abstract":"The excessive transfer of fear acquired for one particular context to similar situations has been implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent evidence suggests that glucose ingestion improves the retention of context conditioning. It has been speculated that glucose might exert that effect by ameliorating hippocampal functioning, and may hold promise as a therapeutic add-on in traumatized patients because improved retention of contextual fear could help to restrict its generalization. However, direct data regarding the effect of glucose on contextual generalization are lacking. Here, we introduce a new behavioral protocol to study such contextual fear generalization in rats. In adult Wistar rats, our procedure yields a gradient of generalization, with progressively less freezing when going from the original training context, over a perceptually similar generalization context, to a markedly dissimilar context. Moreover, we find a flattening of the gradient when the training-test interval is prolonged with 1 week. We next examine the effect of systemic glucose administration on contextual generalization with this novel procedure. Our data do not sustain generalization-reducing effects of glucose and question its applicability in traumatic situations. In summary, we have developed a replicable contextual generalization procedure for rats and demonstrate how it is a valuable tool to examine the neurobiological correlates and test pharmacological interventions pertaining to an important mechanism in the etiology of pathological anxiety.","authors":"L Luyten; N Schroyens; K Luyck; M S Fanselow; T Beckers","keywords":"Hippocampus; Learning and memory; Psychology","organization_affiliated":"Research Group Psychology of Learning and Experimental Psychopathology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Research Group Psychology of Learning and Experimental Psychopathology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Research Group Experimental Neurosurgery and Neuroanatomy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Research Group Experimental Neurosurgery and Neuroanatomy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Research Group Psychology of Learning and Experimental Psychopathology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","title":"No effect of glucose administration in a novel contextual fear generalization protocol in rats","id":"95ac2994-b487-4775-a492-723a37725595"}
{"abstract":"The adenosine A2B receptor is a critical protein in intestinal water secretion. In the present study, we screened compound libraries to identify inhibitors of the A2B receptor and evaluated their effect on adenosine-induced intestinal fluid secretion. The screening identified the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists nifedipine and nisoldipine. Their respective affinities for the A2B receptor (Ki value) were 886 and 1,399 nM. Nifedipine and nisoldipine, but not amlodipine or nitrendipine, inhibited both calcium mobilization and adenosine-induced cAMP accumulation in cell lines. Moreover, adenosine injection into the lumen significantly increased fluid volume in the colonic loop of wild-type mice but not A2B receptor-deficient mice. PSB-1115, a selective A2B receptor antagonist, and nifedipine prevented elevated adenosine-stimulated fluid secretion in mice. Our results may provide useful insights into the structure–activity relationship of dihydropyridines for A2B receptor. As colonic fluid secretion by adenosine seems to rely predominantly on the A2B receptor, nifedipine could be a therapeutic candidate for diarrhoea-related diseases.","authors":"Teita Asano; Yuto Noda; Ken-Ichiro Tanaka; Naoki Yamakawa; Mitsuhito Wada; Tadaaki Mashimo; Yoshifumi Fukunishi; Tohru Mizushima; Mitsuko Takenaga","keywords":"Biophysical chemistry; Gastrointestinal diseases; Pharmacology","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan; LTT Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd, Shiodome Building 3F, Tokyo, Japan; Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Musashino University, Nishi-Tokyo, Japan; School of Pharmacy, Shujitsu University, Okayama, Japan; Technology Research Association for Next Generation Natural Products Chemistry, Tokyo, Japan; Molecular Profiling Research Center for Drug Discovery (molprof), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tokyo, Japan; IMSBIO Co., Ltd., Owl Tower, Tokyo, Japan; Molecular Profiling Research Center for Drug Discovery (molprof), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tokyo, Japan; LTT Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd, Shiodome Building 3F, Tokyo, Japan; Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan","title":"A 2B adenosine receptor inhibition by the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine involves colonic fluid secretion","id":"f006acb7-b1c2-425d-be93-82e5a2281007"}
{"abstract":"Microalgae and plankton can be a rich source of bioactivity. However, induction of secondary metabolite production in lab conditions can be difficult. One simple way of bypassing this issue is to collect biomass in the field and screen for bioactivity. Therefore, bulk net samples from three areas along the coast of northern Norway and Spitsbergen were collected, extracted and fractionated. Biomass samples from a strain of a mass-cultivated diatom Porosira glacialis were used as a reference for comparison to field samples. Screening for bioactivity was performed with 13 assays within four therapeutic areas: antibacterial, anticancer, antidiabetes and antioxidation. We analysed the metabolic profiles of the samples using high resolution - mass spectroscopy (HR-MS). Principal component analysis showed a marked difference in metabolite profiles between the field samples and the photobioreactor culture; furthermore, the number of active fractions and extent of bioactivity was different in the field compared to the photobioreactor samples. We found varying levels of bioactivity in all samples, indicating that complex marine field samples could be used to investigate bioactivities from otherwise inaccessible sources. Furthermore, we hypothesize that metabolic pathways that would otherwise been silent under controlled growth in monocultures, might have been activated in the field samples.","authors":"Richard Andre Ingebrigtsen; Espen Hansen; Jeanette Hammer Andersen; Hans Christian Eilertsen","keywords":"Biotechnology; Drug discovery; Microbial biooceanography","organization_affiliated":"Norwegian College of Fishery Science, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway; Marbio, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway; Marbio, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway; Norwegian College of Fishery Science, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway","title":"Field sampling marine plankton for biodiscovery","id":"d293462c-2692-4b10-8099-cedef191f795"}

In the diagnosis of sepsis — defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and the leading cause of in-patient death and of hospital readmission in the United States — predicting which infections will lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction and developing specific anti-sepsis treatments remain challenging because of the significant heterogeneity of the host response. Yet the use of point-of-care devices could reduce the time from the onset of a patient’s infection to the administration of appropriate therapeutics.

{"abstract":"The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cornerstone of neurophysiological research and clinical neurology. Historically, the classification of EEG as showing normal physiological or abnormal pathological activity has been performed by expert visual review. The potential value of unbiased, automated EEG classification has long been recognized, and in recent years the application of machine learning methods has received significant attention. A variety of solutions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for EEG classification have emerged with impressive results. However, interpretation of CNN results and their connection with underlying basic electrophysiology has been unclear. This paper proposes a CNN architecture, which enables interpretation of intracranial EEG (iEEG) transients driving classification of brain activity as normal, pathological or artifactual. The goal is accomplished using CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM). We show that the method allows the visualization of iEEG graphoelements with the highest contribution to the final classification result using a classification heatmap and thus enables review of the raw iEEG data and interpret the decision of the model by electrophysiology means.","authors":"P.

{"abstract":"Synthetic recoding of genomes, to remove targeted sense codons, may facilitate the encoded cellular synthesis of unnatural polymers by orthogonal translation systems. However, our limited understanding of allowed synonymous codon substitutions, and the absence of methods that enable the stepwise replacement of the Escherichia coli genome with long synthetic DNA and provide feedback on allowed and disallowed design features in synthetic genomes, have restricted progress towards this goal. Here we endow E. coli with a system for efficient, programmable replacement of genomic DNA with long (\u003e100-kb) synthetic DNA, through the in vivo excision of double-stranded DNA from an episomal replicon by CRISPR/Cas9, coupled to lambda-red-mediated recombination and simultaneous positive and negative selection. We iterate the approach, providing a basis for stepwise whole-genome replacement. We attempt systematic recoding in an essential operon using eight synonymous recoding schemes. Each scheme systematically replaces target codons with defined synonyms and is compatible with codon reassignment. Our results define allowed and disallowed synonymous recoding schemes, and enable the identification and repair of recoding at idiosyncratic positions in the genome. REXER, a new method that allows long sections of DNA to be inserted or replaced in the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, is used to investigate codon replacement schemes for the generation of synthetic genomes. REXER (Replicon EXcision for Enhanced genome engineering through programmed Recombination) is a novel method that enables large DNA fragments to be inserted into the Escherichia coli genome, and can be iterated to the replacement of large genomic fragments with synthetic DNA. Jason Chin and colleagues show the applicability of the method for large-scale recoding of an E. coli operon, and systematically investigate the tolerability of synonymous codon replacement schemes, defining idiosyncratic positions that are refractory to recoding. The approach may be further implemented as a tool to accelerate the generation of synthetic genomes.","authors":"Kaihang Wang; Julius Fredens; Simon F. Brunner; Samuel H. Kim; Tiongsun Chia; Jason W.

{"abstract":"miRNAs are endogenous regulatory factors that play pivotal roles in post-transcriptional regulation. However, their specific roles in early somatic embryogenesis (SE) remain unclear. Study of the SE system is fundamental for clarifying the molecular mechanisms in Dimocarpus longan. We identified 289 known miRNAs from 106 different miRNA families and 1087 novel miRNAs during early longan SE, including embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete pro-embryogenic culture (ICpEC), globular embryo (GE), and non-embryogenic callus (NEC). The abundances of known miRNAs were concentrated in GE. The differentially expression (DE) miRNAs showed five expression patterns during early SE. Largely miRNAs were expressed highly and specially in EC, ICpEC, and GE, respectively. Some miRNAs and putative target genes were enriched in lignin metabolism. Most potential targets were related to the pathways of plant hormone signal transduction, alternative splicing, tyrosine metabolism and sulfur metabolism in early longan SE. The regulatory relationships between dlo-miR166a-3p and DlHD-zip8, dlo-miR397a and DlLAC7, dlo-miR408-3p and DlLAC12 were confirmed by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The expression patterns of eight DE miRNAs detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with RNA-seq. Finally, the miRNA regulatory network in early SE was constructed, which provided new insight into molecular mechanism of early SE in longan.","authors":"Xiaoping Xu; Xiaohui Chen; Yan Chen; Qinglin Zhang; Liyao Su; Xu Chen; Yukun Chen; Zihao Zhang; Yuling Lin; Zhongxiong Lai","keywords":"Biological techniques; Biotechnology; Cell biology; Computational biology and bioinformatics; Developmental biology; Molecular biology; Plant sciences; Stem cells","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China; Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China","title":"Genome-wide identification of miRNAs and their targets during early somatic embryogenesis in Dimocarpus longan Lour.","id":"0d549ba8-6a26-4b57-8afb-58db02363c55"}
{"abstract":"In this study we compared the anatomic and functional outcomes of two steroid treatments on rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) combined with choroidal detachment (CD), namely treatment with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily) for 3–7 days before vitrectomy or a single periocular injection of methylprednisolone (40 mg) 1–3 days before vitrectomy. We also analyzed the outcomes of the eyes with subsided CD and the eyes with persistent CD that underwent drainage of suprachoroidal fluids during the vitrectomy. This was a prospective randomized study. Seventy five eyes with RRD combined with CD were divided into 2 groups based on the two different treatment regimens as above. The eyes in each group were further divided into 2 subgroups (A: CD subsided eyes; B: CD persistent eyes) according to the response of CD to the treatment of steroids. Retinal reattachment rates were measured at 6 months after the removal of silicone oil. At 6 months after silicone oil removal, the retinal reattachment rate was similar (p = 0.666) in the oral prednisolone group (91.7%, 33/36) and the periocular injection group (94.9%, 37/39). Similar retinal reattachment rates (p = 0.364) were also found in the CD subsided eyes (97.1%, 34/35) and the CD persistent eyes (90.0%, 36/40). The retinal reattachment rate was comparable among the subgroups (p = 0.395; oral prednisolone A group: 95.2%, 20/21; oral prednisolone B group: 86.7%, 13/15; periocular injection A group: 100%, 14/14; periocular injection B group: 92.0%, 23/25). For RRD combined with CD, eyes treated with a single periocular injection of methylprednisolone (40 mg, 1–3 days before pars plana vitrectomy) combined with the drainage of suprachoroidal fluids during the surgery had similar anatomic and functional outcomes compared to the eyes treated with oral prednisolone for 3–7 days before vitrectomy.","authors":"Yong Wei; RongLe Zhou; Xiaobo Wang; Xiuju Chen; Hao Chen","keywords":"Retinal diseases; Uveal diseases","organization_affiliated":"The Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Xiamen Eye Center Affiliated to Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Shaanxi Ophthalmic Medical Center, Xi’an No.4 Hospital, Affiliated Guangren Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; Xiamen Eye Center Affiliated to Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Xiamen Eye Center Affiliated to Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; The Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China","title":"The effect of single periocular injection of methylprednisolone and drainage of suprachoroidal fluid in the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment combined with choroidal detachment","id":"4eb846be-daed-44ad-96db-944c577d215b"}
{"abstract":"Metastasis is one of the most common reasons of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) death; however, the molecular mechanism underlying HCC metastasis remains incompletely defined. Here we report a new function of Zinc Finger Protein 703 (ZNF703), a member of the NET/NlZ family of zinc finger transcription factors, in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. We demonstrated that the overexpression of ZNF703 in human HCC tissue is correlated with tumor metastasis and recurrence, it is also related with the prognosis and survival rate of patients. ZNF703 overexpression promotes HCC progression in vitro and in vivo, whereas ZNF703 knockdown has the opposite effect. In addition, ZNF703 induces epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) via directly binding to the CLDN4 promoter and transactivating CLDN4 expression. Downregulation of CLDN4 can attenuate ZNF703-mediated HCC metastasis, whereas upregulation of CLDN4 can reverse the decreased metastasis induced by ZNF703 knockdown. Our data revealed that ZNF703 expression is correlated with CLDN4 level, the overexpression of both ZNF703 and CLDN4 are leaded to poorer prognosis of patients with HCC. Moreover, ZNF703 knockdown can enhance the sensitivity of HCC cell to sorafenib, whereas ZNF703 overexpression has the opposite effect. These results suggested that ZNF703 might be a potential target for cancer therapies and a candidate prognostic biomarker for predicting whether patients with HCC are befitting for sorafenib treatment.","authors":"Hao Wang; Hongfa Xu; Feng Ma; Meixiao Zhan; Xiangyu Yang; Shengni Hua; Wei Li; Yong Li; Ligong Lu","keywords":"Prognostic markers; Tumour biomarkers","organization_affiliated":"Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China; Zhuhai Interventional Medical Center, Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People’s Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China","title":"Zinc finger protein 703 induces EMT and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by transactivating CLDN4 expression","id":"47ae913f-50fb-4905-91b9-c22ddd8946ff"}
{"abstract":"Reducing the noble metal loading and increasing the specific activity of the oxygen evolution catalysts are omnipresent challenges in proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis, which have recently been tackled by utilizing mixed oxides of noble and non-noble elements. However, proper verification of the stability of these materials is still pending. Here we introduce a metric to explore the dissolution processes of various iridium-based oxides, defined as the ratio between the amounts of evolved oxygen and dissolved iridium. The so-called stability number is independent of loading, surface area or involved active sites and provides a reasonable comparison of diverse materials with respect to stability. The case study on iridium-based perovskites shows that leaching of the non-noble elements in mixed oxides leads to the formation of highly active amorphous iridium oxide, the instability of which is explained by the generation of short-lived vacancies that favour dissolution. These insights are meant to guide further research, which should be devoted to increasing the utilization of highly durable pure crystalline iridium oxide and finding solutions to stabilize amorphous iridium oxides. The proper verification of the stability of metal oxide catalysts for water electrolysis in acid electrolyte remains unresolved. Here, the ‘stability number’ is introduced to evaluate the dissolution mechanisms of various iridium-based oxides and to facilitate benchmarking of catalysts independent of loading, surface area or involved active sites.

{"abstract":"We replace the established aluminium gates for the formation of quantum dots in silicon with gates made from palladium. We study the morphology of both aluminium and palladium gates with transmission electron microscopy. The native aluminium oxide is found to be formed all around the aluminium gates, which could lead to the formation of unintentional dots. Therefore, we report on a novel fabrication route that replaces aluminium and its native oxide by palladium with atomic-layer-deposition-grown aluminium oxide. Using this approach, we show the formation of low-disorder gate-defined quantum dots, which are reproducibly fabricated. Furthermore, palladium enables us to further shrink the gate design, allowing us to perform electron transport measurements in the few-electron regime in devices comprising only two gate layers, a major technological advancement. It remains to be seen, whether the introduction of palladium gates can improve the excellent results on electron and nuclear spin qubits defined with an aluminium gate stack.","authors":"Matthias Brauns; Sergey V.

{"abstract":"In response to rising water scarcity concerns around the world, water utilities are expanding and diversifying their water supply portfolios, including attempting to value and reuse every drop throughout the water cycle. This transition is creating new hybrid infrastructure systems that combine centralized and decentralized sources at various scales. To help strategize and manage these emerging hybrid systems, we introduce a flexible goal-based water-trading framework using a combination of regulatory and market incentives. We apply this framework in a simulation of the San Francisco Bay Area, and test the effects of policy parameters, local preferences and collaboration between utilities. Results show that the option of engaging in an open trading scheme can lead to a more strategic and holistic path to higher regional resiliency through increased diversity in water portfolios, at lower costs than if utilities were tasked with pursuing goals independently. Highest benefits are observed when utilities cooperate in the exchange of information, which highlights the importance of transparency and trust operating in conjunction with regulatory and market forces. Water utilities worldwide are diversifying their portfolios of water supplies to smooth growing variation in water availability. This simulation finds that the option of engaging in an open water-trading scheme in the San Francisco Bay Area could promote regional resiliency and lowers costs.","authors":"P. Gonzales; N. K.

{"abstract":"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas9) system has become a revolutionary tool for gene editing. Since viral delivery systems have significant side effects, and naked DNA delivery is not an option, the nontoxic, non-viral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components would significantly improve future therapeutic delivery. In this study, we aim at characterizing nanoparticles to deliver plasmid DNA encoding for the CRISPR-Cas system in eukaryotic cells in vitro. CRISPR/Cas9 complexed polyethylenimine (PEI) magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were generated. We used a stable HEK293 cell line expressing the traffic light reporter (TLR-3) system to evaluate efficient homology- directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) events following transfection with NPs. MNPs have been synthesized by co-precipitation with the average particle size around 20 nm in diameter. The dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements showed that NPs exhibited narrow size distribution and sufficient colloidal stability. Genome editing events were as efficient as compared to standard lipofectamine transfection. Our approach tested non-viral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNA template to perform HDR and NHEJ in the same assay. We demonstrated that PEI-MNPs is a promising delivery system for plasmids encoding CRISPR/Cas9 and template DNA and thus can improve safety and utility of gene editing.","authors":"S. S. Rohiwal; N.

{"abstract":"Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with several cardiovascular pathologies and with cell cycle exit by neonanatal cardiomyocytes, a key limiting factor in the regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart. The polycomb complex component BMI1 is linked to adult progenitors and is an important partner in DNA repair and redox regulation. We found that high BMI1 expression is associated with an adult Sca1+ cardiac progenitor sub-population with low ROS levels. In homeostasis, BMI1 repressed cell fate genes, including a cardiogenic differentiation program. Oxidative damage nonetheless modified BMI1 activity in vivo by derepressing canonical target genes in favor of their antioxidant and anticlastogenic functions. This redox-mediated mechanism is not restricted to damage situations, however, and we report ROS-associated differentiation of cardiac progenitors in steady state. These findings demonstrate how redox status influences the cardiac progenitor response, and identify redox-mediated BMI1 regulation with implications in maintenance of cellular identity in vivo.","authors":"Diego Herrero; María Tomé; Susana Cañón; Francisco M.

{"abstract":"The Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is administered parenterally to infants and young children to prevent tuberculosis (TB) infection. However, the protection induced by BCG is highly variable and the vaccine does not prevent pulmonary TB, the most common form of the illness. Until improved TB vaccines are available, it is crucial to use BCG in a manner which ensures optimal vaccine performance. Immunization directly to the respiratory mucosa has been shown to promote greater protection from TB in animal models. γδ T cells play a major role in host defense at mucosal sites and are known to respond robustly to mycobacterial infection. Their positioning in the respiratory mucosa ensures their engagement in the response to aerosolized TB vaccination. However, our understanding of the effect of respiratory BCG vaccination on γδ T cell responses in the lung is unknown. In this study, we used a calf model to investigate the immunogenicity of aerosol BCG vaccination, and the phenotypic profile of peripheral and mucosal γδ T cells responding to vaccination. We observed robust local and systemic M. bovis-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 production by both γδ and CD4 T cells. Importantly, BCG vaccination induced effector and memory cell differentiation of γδ T cells in both the lower airways and peripheral blood, with accumulation of a large proportion of effector memory γδ T cells in both compartments. Our results demonstrate the potential of the neonatal calf model to evaluate TB vaccine candidates that are to be administered via the respiratory tract, and suggest that aerosol immunization is a promising strategy for engaging γδ T cells in vaccine-induced immunity against TB.","authors":"Mariana Guerra-Maupome; Jodi L.

{"abstract":"Coincident climatic and human effects strongly influence water-quality properties in estuarine-coastal ecosystems around the world. Time-series data for a number of ecosystems reveal high spatio-temporal variability superimposed on secular trends traceable to nutrient over-enrichment. In this paper, we present new analyses of long-term data for Chesapeake Bay directed at several goals: (1) to distinguish trends from spatio-temporal variability imposed by climatic effects; (2) to assess long-term trends of water-quality properties reflecting degradation and recovery; (3) to propose numerical water-quality criteria as targets for restoration; (4) to assess progress toward attainment of these targets. The bay has experienced multiple impairments associated with nutrient over-enrichment since World War II, e.g., low dissolved oxygen (DO), decreased water clarity, and harmful algal blooms (HAB). Anthropogenic eutrophication has been expressed as increased chlorophyll-a (chl-a) driven by accelerated nutrient loading from 1945 to 1980. Management intervention led to decreased loading thereafter, but deleterious symptoms of excess nutrients persist. Climatic effects exemplified by irregular “dry” and “wet” periods in the last 30+ years largely explain high inter-annual variability of water-quality properties, requiring adjustments to resolve long-term trends. Here, we extend these analyses at a finer temporal scale to six decades of chl-a, Secchi depth, and nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 + NO3) data to support trend analyses and the development of numerical water-quality criteria. The proposed criteria build on a conceptual model emphasizing the need to distinguish climatic and human effects in gauging progress to reverse eutrophication in estuarine-coastal ecosystems.","authors":"Lawrence W.

{"abstract":"Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have been suggested as a novel treatment for obesity and diabetes. We have developed a synthetic cannabinoid receptor antagonist denominated BAR-1. As the function and integrity of a β-cell cellular structure are important keys for diabetes onset, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological administration of BAR-1 on prediabetic and diabetic rodents. CD-1 mice fed a hypercaloric diet or treated with streptozotocin were treated with 10 mg/kg BAR-1 for 2, 4 or 8 weeks. Body weight, oral glucose tolerance test, HbA1c, triglycerides and insulin in serum were measured. In isolated islets, we evaluated stimulated secretion and mRNA expression, and relative area of islets in fixed pancreases. Docking analysis of BAR-1 was complemented. BAR-1 treatment slowed down weight gain in prediabetic mice. Fasting glucose–insulin relation also decreased in BAR-1-treated mice and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was increased in isolated islets, without effects in oral test. Diabetic mice treated with BAR-1 showed a reduced glucose and a partial recovery of islet integrity. Gene expression of insulin and glucagon showed biphasic behaviour, increasing after 4 weeks of BAR-1 administration; however, after 8 weeks, mRNA abundance decreased significantly. Administration of BAR-1 also prevents changes in endocannabinoid element expression observed in prediabetic mice.

{"abstract":"The activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle coordinates systemic metabolic responses to exercise1. Autophagy—a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis2—is upregulated during exercise, and a core autophagy protein, beclin 1, is required for AMPK activation in skeletal muscle3. Here we describe a role for the innate immune-sensing molecule Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)4, and its interaction with beclin 1, in exercise-induced activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Mice that lack TLR9 are deficient in both exercise-induced activation of AMPK and plasma membrane localization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle, but are not deficient in autophagy. TLR9 binds beclin 1, and this interaction is increased by energy stress (glucose starvation and endurance exercise) and decreased by a BCL2 mutation3,5 that blocks the disruption of BCL2–beclin 1 binding. TLR9 regulates the assembly of the endolysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C2)—which contains beclin 1 and UVRAG—in skeletal muscle during exercise, and knockout of beclin 1 or UVRAG inhibits the cellular AMPK activation induced by glucose starvation. Moreover, TLR9 functions in a muscle-autonomous fashion in ex vivo contraction-induced AMPK activation, glucose uptake and beclin 1–UVRAG complex assembly. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role for a Toll-like receptor in skeletal-muscle AMPK activation and glucose metabolism during exercise, as well as unexpected crosstalk between this innate immune sensor and autophagy proteins. In mice, the interaction of the innate immune sensor TLR9 with beclin 1 is shown to have a role in glucose metabolism and AMPK activation in skeletal muscle during exercise.","authors":"Yang Liu; Phong T.

{"abstract":"Peach (Prunus persica) is an economically important fruit crop and a well-characterized model for studying Prunus species. Here we explore the evolutionary history of peach using a large-scale SNP data set generated from 58 high-coverage genomes of cultivated peach and closely related relatives, including 44 newly re-sequenced accessions and 14 accessions from a previous study. Our analyses suggest that peach originated about 2.47 Mya in southwest China in glacial refugia generated by the uplift of the Tibetan plateau. Our exploration of genomic selection signatures and demographic history supports the hypothesis that frugivore-mediated selection occurred several million years before the eventual human-mediated domestication of peach. We also identify a large set of SNPs and/or CNVs, and candidate genes associated with fruit texture, taste, size, and skin color, with implications for genomic-selection breeding in peach. Collectively, this study provides valuable information for understanding the evolution and domestication of perennial fruit tree crops. Peach is an economically important fruit crop. Here, the authors carry out a large-scale population genomics analysis of peach, describing its demographic history as well as genes associated with domestication and edibility traits.","authors":"Yang Yu; Jun Fu; Yaoguang Xu; Jiewei Zhang; Fei Ren; Hongwei Zhao; Shilin Tian; Wei Guo; Xiaolong Tu; Jing Zhao; Dawei Jiang; Jianbo Zhao; Weiying Wu; Gaochao Wang; Rongcai Ma; Quan Jiang; Jianhua Wei; Hua Xie","keywords":"Evolution; Genomics; Plant evolution","organization_affiliated":"Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, Beijing, China; Beijing 8omics Gene Technology Co.

{"abstract":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a novel class of noncoding RNAs which potential role as gene regulators is quickly gaining interest. circRNAs have been studied in different tissues and cell types across several animal species. However, a thorough characterization of the circRNAome in ejaculated sperm remains unexplored. In this study, we profiled the sperm circRNA catalogue using 40 porcine ejaculates. A complex population of 1,598 circRNAs was shared in at least 30 of the 40 samples. Generally speaking, the predicted circRNAs presented low abundances and were tissue-specific. Around 80% of the circRNAs identified in the boar sperm were reported as novel. Results from abundance correlation between circRNAs and miRNAs together with the prediction of microRNA (miRNA) target sites in circRNAs suggested that circRNAs may act as miRNA sponges. Moreover, we found significant correlations between the abundance of 148 exonic circRNAs and sperm motility parameters. Two of these correlations, involving ssc_circ_1458 and ssc_circ_1321, were confirmed by RT-qPCR using 36 additional samples with extreme and opposite sperm motility values. Our study provides a thorough characterization of circRNAs in sperm and suggests that circRNAs hold potential as noninvasive biomarkers for sperm quality and male fertility.","authors":"Marta Gòdia; Anna Castelló; Martina Rocco; Betlem Cabrera; Joan Enric Rodríguez-Gil; Sam Balasch; Craig Lewis; Armand Sánchez; Alex Clop","keywords":"Animal breeding; Gene expression; Gene expression profiling","organization_affiliated":"Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Unit of Animal Science, Department of Animal and Food Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Unit of Animal Reproduction, Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Unit of Animal Science, Department of Animal and Food Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Unit of Animal Reproduction, Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Grup Gepork S.A., Barcelona, Spain; PIC Europe, Sant Cugat del Vallés, Spain; Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Unit of Animal Science, Department of Animal and Food Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Animal Genomics Group, Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain","title":"Identification of circular RNAs in porcine sperm and evaluation of their relation to sperm motility","id":"e76d260f-251c-4d49-b0f1-474fc6d38057"}
{"abstract":"Sparassis crispa (Hanabiratake) is a widely used medicinal mushroom in traditional Chinese medicine because it contains materials with pharmacological activity. Here, we report its 39.0-Mb genome, encoding 13,157 predicted genes, obtained using next-generation sequencing along with RNA-seq mapping data. A phylogenetic analysis by comparison with 25 other fungal genomes revealed that S. crispa diverged from Postia placenta, a brown-rot fungus, 94 million years ago. Several features specific to the genome were found, including the A-mating type locus with the predicted genes for HD1 and HD2 heterodomain transcription factors, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), and the B-mating type locus with seven potential pheromone receptor genes and three potential pheromone precursor genes. To evaluate the benefits of the extract and chemicals from S. crispa, we adopted two approaches: (1) characterization of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes and β-glucan synthase genes and the clusters of genes for the synthesis of second metabolites, such as terpenes, indoles and polyketides, and (2) identification of estrogenic activity in its mycelial extract. Two potential β-glucan synthase genes, ScrFKS1 and ScrFKS2, corresponding to types I and II, respectively, characteristic of Agaricomycetes mushrooms, were newly identified by the search for regions homologous to the reported features of β-glucan synthase genes; both contained the characteristic transmembrane regions and the regions homologous to the catalytic domain of the yeast β-glucan synthase gene FKS1. Rapid estrogenic cell-signaling and DNA microarray-based transcriptome analyses revealed the presence of a new category of chemicals with estrogenic activity, silent estrogens, in the extract. The elucidation of the S. crispa genome and its genes will expand the potential of this organism for medicinal and pharmacological purposes.","authors":"Ryoiti Kiyama; Yoshiyuki Furutani; Kayoko Kawaguchi; Toshio Nakanishi","keywords":"Endocrine system and metabolic diseases; Evolutionary genetics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Life Science, Faculty of Life Science, Kyushu Sangyo Univ., Higashi-ku, Japan; Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Tokyo Women’s Medical Univ., Shinjuku-ku, Japan; Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Tokyo Women’s Medical Univ., Shinjuku-ku, Japan; Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Tokyo Women’s Medical Univ., Shinjuku-ku, Japan","title":"Genome sequence of the cauliflower mushroom Sparassis crispa (Hanabiratake) and its association with beneficial usage","id":"25fcba77-4b92-47a6-b03c-782779e262cb"}

{"abstract":"Polyclonal antibodies, derived from humans or hyperimmunized animals, have been used prophylactically or therapeutically as countermeasures for a variety of infectious diseases. SAB Biotherapeutics has successfully developed a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform technology that can produce fully human immunoglobulins rapidly, and in substantial quantities, against a variety of disease targets. In this study, two Tc bovines expressing high levels of fully human IgG were hyperimmunized with a recombinant glycoprotein (GP) vaccine consisting of the 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) Makona isolate. Serum collected from these hyperimmunized Tc bovines contained high titers of human IgG against EBOV GP as determined by GP specific ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and virus neutralization assays. Fully human polyclonal antibodies against EBOV were purified and evaluated in a mouse challenge model using mouse adapted Ebola virus (maEBOV). Intraperitoneal administration of the purified anti-EBOV IgG (100 mg/kg) to BALB/c mice one day after lethal challenge with maEBOV resulted in 90% protection; whereas 100% of the control animals succumbed. The results show that hyperimmunization of Tc bovines with EBOV GP can elicit protective and potent neutralizing fully human IgG antibodies rapidly and in commercially viable quantities.","authors":"John M.

{"abstract":"There is concern that African-American men (AA) with low-risk prostate cancer may present with more aggressive disease and thus may not be candidates for active surveillance (AS). However, it is uncertain if poorer outcomes are due to disparities in access to medical care rather than true biological differences. Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with low-risk PC—Gleason score ≤6, clinical tumor stage ≤2A, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level ≤10—at US Department of Veterans Affairs between January 1, 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with radical prostatectomy. Outcomes included upgrading to Gleason Grade Group 2 (GG2), GG ≥ 3, PSA recurrence, pathologic tumor stage ≥3, positive surgical margins, and all-cause mortality. A total of 2857 men (AA: 835 White: 2022) with a median follow-up of 7.1 years. Overall, there was no significant difference between AA and White men in upgrading to GG ≥ 3 (RR = 1.18, p = 0.43), tumor stage ≥3 (RR = 0.95, p = 0.74), positive surgical margins (RR = 1.14, p = 0.20), PSA recurrence (SHR = 1.26, p = 0.06), and all-cause mortality (SHR = 1.26, p = 0.16). However, there was a significant increase in upgrading for AA to GG2 (RR = 1.49, p \u003c 0.01). There was no significant difference in most adverse pathologic outcomes between AA and White patients. However, GG2 upgrading was more common in AA men. The implication is that AA may need to undergo additional evaluation, such as a biopsy MRI, before initiating AS. Whether the increase in GG2 upgrading will lead to poorer long-term clinical outcomes such as metastasis and PCSM also requires further investigation.","authors":"Rishi Deka; J.

{"abstract":"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1, 2 and 3 form the catalytic subunit of several large transcriptional repression complexes. Unexpectedly, the enzymatic activity of HDACs in these complexes has been shown to be regulated by inositol phosphates, which bind in a pocket sandwiched between the HDAC and co-repressor proteins. However, the actual mechanism of activation remains poorly understood. Here we have elucidated the stereochemical requirements for binding and activation by inositol phosphates, demonstrating that activation requires three adjacent phosphate groups and that other positions on the inositol ring can tolerate bulky substituents. We also demonstrate that there is allosteric communication between the inositol-binding site and the active site. The crystal structure of the HDAC1:MTA1 complex bound to a novel peptide-based inhibitor and to inositol hexaphosphate suggests a molecular basis of substrate recognition, and an entropically driven allosteric mechanism of activation. Class I histone deacetylase complexes can be activated by inositol phosphates. Here, the authors investigate the stereochemical requirements for activation; use the crystal structure to understand substrate recognition, and suggest an entropically driven mechanism of allostery.

{"abstract":"Damian Smedley and colleagues report the phenotypic characterization of the first 3,328 genes by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. They develop new mouse models based on genes known to be associated with human mendelian diseases and identify potential disease-associated genes with little or no previous functional annotation. Although next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the ability to associate variants with human diseases, diagnostic rates and development of new therapies are still limited by a lack of knowledge of the functions and pathobiological mechanisms of most genes. To address this challenge, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium is creating a genome- and phenome-wide catalog of gene function by characterizing new knockout-mouse strains across diverse biological systems through a broad set of standardized phenotyping tests. All mice will be readily available to the biomedical community. Analyzing the first 3,328 genes identified models for 360 diseases, including the first models, to our knowledge, for type C Bernard–Soulier, Bardet–Biedl-5 and Gordon Holmes syndromes. 90% of our phenotype annotations were novel, providing functional evidence for 1,092 genes and candidates in genetically uncharacterized diseases including arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 3. Finally, we describe our role in variant functional validation with The 100,000 Genomes Project and others.","authors":"Terrence F Meehan; Nathalie Conte; David B West; Julius O Jacobsen; Jeremy Mason;

{"abstract":"Cellular activation and inflammation leading to endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated whether a single cell label-free multi parameter optical interrogation system can detect endothelial cell and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) activation in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) before endothelial activation was validated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of inflammatory marker expression (PECAM-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1). A centrifugal microfluidic system and V-cup array was used to capture individual cells before optical measurement of light scattering, immunocytofluorescence, auto-fluorescence (AF) and cell morphology was determined. In vitro, TNF-α promoted specific changes to the refractive index and cell morphology of individual cells concomitant with enhanced photon activity of fluorescently labelled inflammatory markers and increased auto-fluorescence (AF) intensity at three different wavelengths, an effect blocked by inhibition of downstream signalling with Iκβ. Ex vivo, there was a significant increase in EPC number and AF intensity of individual EPCs from CVD patients concomitant with enhanced PECAM-1 expression when compared to normal controls. This novel label-free ‘lab on a disc’ (LoaD) platform can successfully detect endothelial activation in response to inflammatory stimuli in vitro and ex vivo.","authors":"Damien King; MacDara Glynn; Sandra Cindric; David Kernan; Tríona O’Connell; Roya Hakimjavadi; Sinéad Kearney; Tobias Ackermann; Xavier Munoz Berbel; Andreu Llobera; Ulf Simonsen; Britt E.

{"abstract":"Cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) of 2–6 kDa are generally thermally and proteolytically stable because of their multiple cross-bracing disulfide bonds. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of two novel cystine-stapled CRPs, designated lybatide 1 and 2 (lyba1 and lyba2), from the cortex of Lycium barbarum root. Lybatides, 32 to 33 amino acids in length, are hyperstable and display a novel disulfide connectivity with a cysteine motif of C-C-C-C-CC-CC which contains two pairs of adjacent cysteines (-CC-CC). X-ray structure analysis revealed the presence of a single cystine-stabilized (α + π)-helix in lyba2, a rare feature of CRPs. Together, our results suggest that lybatides, one of the smallest four-disulfide-constrained plant CRPs, is a new family of CRPs. Additionally, this study provides new insights into the molecular diversity of plant cysteine-rich peptides and the unusual lybatide scaffold could be developed as a useful template for peptide engineering and therapeutic development.","authors":"Wei Liang Tan; Ka H.

{"abstract":"Alfvén waves are fundamental plasma wave modes that permeate the universe. At small kinetic scales, they provide a critical mechanism for the transfer of energy between electromagnetic fields and charged particles. These waves are important not only in planetary magnetospheres, heliospheres and astrophysical systems but also in laboratory plasma experiments and fusion reactors. Through measurement of charged particles and electromagnetic fields with NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we utilize Earth’s magnetosphere as a plasma physics laboratory. Here we confirm the conservative energy exchange between the electromagnetic field fluctuations and the charged particles that comprise an undamped kinetic Alfvén wave. Electrons confined between adjacent wave peaks may have contributed to saturation of damping effects via nonlinear particle trapping. The investigation of these detailed wave dynamics has been unexplored territory in experimental plasma physics and is only recently enabled by high-resolution MMS observations. Alfvén waves are fundamental plasma modes that provide a mechanism for the transfer of energy between particles and fields.

{"abstract":"CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been suggested to play a critical role in cancer metastasis. Some studies have described CXCR4 nuclear localization in metastatic lesions of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which has been suggested to be correlated with cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism and clinical significance of CXCR4 nuclear localization remains unknown. Here, we show that CXCR4 nuclear localization is more likely to occur in RCC tissues, especially in metastases, and is associated with poor prognosis. CXCR4 nuclear localization requires its nuclear localization sequence (NLS, residues 146-RPRK-149). After the mutation of NLS in CXCR4, CXCR4 nuclear localization in RCC cells is lost. Nuclear localization of CXCR4 promoted RCC tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that CXCR4 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) colocalized in RCC cells and interacted with each other. Moreover, CXCR4 nuclear localization promoted nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α, thereby promoting the expression of genes downstream of HIF-1α. Reciprocally, nuclear HIF-1α promoted CXCR4 transcription, thus forming a feed-forward loop. Subcellular CXCR4 and HIF-1α expression levels were independent adverse prognostic factors and could be combined with TNM stage to generate a predictive nomogram of the clinical outcome of patients with RCC. Therefore, our findings indicate that CXCR4 nuclear translocation plays a critical role in RCC metastasis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.","authors":"Yi Bao; Zhixiang Wang; Bing Liu; Xin Lu; Ying Xiong; Jiazi Shi; Peng Li; Junming Chen; Zongqin Zhang; Ming Chen; Linhui Wang; Zhenjie Wu","keywords":"Nuclear organization; Prognostic markers; Renal cell carcinoma","organization_affiliated":"Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, the 458th Hospital of PLA, Guangzhou, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, No.153 Hospital of PLA, Zhengzhou, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Henan Provincial Corps Hospital of Chinese People’s Armed Police Forces, Zhengzhou, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China; Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China","title":"A feed-forward loop between nuclear translocation of CXCR4 and HIF-1α promotes renal cell carcinoma metastasis","id":"aa60640f-2005-4888-889b-c69e771625c4"}
{"abstract":"The abundant expression of collagen type VI α5 (COL6A5) exists in lung tissue, and its role in lung cancer is still unknown. We performed a genetic association study with an attempt to detect the relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in COL6A5 and lung cancer predisposition in Chinese Han population. We finally selected six tag-SNPs to determine their genotypes among 510 lung cancer patients and 495 healthy controls with the MassARRAY platform. The associations of SNPs and lung cancer risk were estimated by logistic regression method with adjustment for confounding factors. Two available databases were used for gene expression and prognosis analysis. COL6A5 rs13062453, rs1497305, and rs77123808 were significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer in the whole population or stratified subgroups (p \u003c 0.05). Among them, COL6A5 rs13062453 and rs1497305 were also linked to the susceptibility of lung adenocarcinoma.

{"abstract":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and plant development. Here, we identified 6,510 lncRNAs in Arabidopsis under normal or stress conditions. We found that the expression of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) that are transcribed in the opposite direction of protein-coding genes often positively correlates with and is required for the expression of their cognate sense genes. We further characterized MAS, a NAT-lncRNA produced from the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) locus. MAS is induced by cold and indispensable for the activation of MAF4 transcription and suppression of precocious flowering. MAS activates MAF4 by interacting with WDR5a, one core component of the COMPASS-like complexes, and recruiting WDR5a to MAF4 to enhance histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Our study greatly extends the repertoire of lncRNAs in Arabidopsis and reveals a role for NAT-lncRNAs in regulating gene expression in vernalization response and likely in other biological processes. Long non-coding RNAs regulate developmental transitions and stress responses in plants. Here Zhao et al. show that a non-coding antisense transcript MAS transcribed from the Arabidopsis MAF4 locus activates H3K4me3 deposition and MAF4 transcription to suppress precocious flowering.","authors":"Xinyue Zhao; Jingrui Li; Bi Lian; Hanqing Gu; Yan Li; Yijun Qi","keywords":"Long non-coding RNAs; Plant molecular biology","organization_affiliated":"Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China; Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Center for Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China","title":"Global identification of Arabidopsis lncRNAs reveals the regulation of MAF4 by a natural antisense RNA","id":"a4782fa0-d76a-4130-bba5-2ac2a71679ac"}
{"abstract":"A negative regulator of the Wnt pathway secreted by tumor cells promotes immune evasion by suppressing lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Immunotherapy offers new options for cancer treatment, but efficacy varies across cancer types. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are largely refractory to immune-checkpoint blockade, which suggests the presence of yet uncharacterized immune-suppressive mechanisms. Here we report that the loss of adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) in intestinal tumor cells or of the tumor suppressor PTEN in melanoma cells upregulates the expression of Dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2), which, together with its receptor LRP5, provides an unconventional mechanism for tumor immune evasion. DKK2 secreted by tumor cells acts on cytotoxic lymphocytes, inhibiting STAT5 signaling by impeding STAT5 nuclear localization via LRP5, but independently of LRP6 and the Wnt–β-catenin pathway. Genetic or antibody-mediated ablation of DKK2 activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells in tumors, impedes tumor progression, and enhances the effects of PD-1 blockade. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown tumor immune-suppressive mechanism and immunotherapeutic targets particularly relevant for CRCs and a subset of melanomas.","authors":"Qian Xiao; Jibo Wu; Wei-Jia Wang; Shiyang Chen; Yingxia Zheng; Xiaoqing Yu; Katrina Meeth; Mahnaz Sahraei; Alfred L M Bothwell; Lieping Chen; Marcus Bosenberg; Jianfeng Chen; Veronika Sexl; Le Sun; Lin Li; Wenwen Tang; Dianqing Wu","keywords":"Immunosuppression; Immunosurveillance; Morphogen signalling","organization_affiliated":"Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Biostatistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, USA; Departments of Dermatology and Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Departments of Dermatology and Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Department for Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria; AbMax, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program and Department of Pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA","title":"DKK2 imparts tumor immunity evasion through β-catenin-independent suppression of cytotoxic immune-cell activation","id":"831c5b89-4268-4284-b062-b1be6a47ce46"}
{"abstract":"Rapid advances in clinical technologies, detection sensitivity and analytical throughput have delivered a significant expansion in our knowledge of prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in many common infectious diseases, such as Tuberculosis (TB). During the last decade, a significant number of approaches to TB diagnosis have been attempted at Point-of-Care (PoC), exploiting a large variation of techniques and materials. In this work, we describe an electronics-based Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (eELISA), using a Lab-on-a-Printed Circuit Board (LoPCB) approach, for TB diagnosis based on cytokine detection. The test relies upon an electrochemical (amperometric) assay, comprising a high-precision bioinstrumentation board and amperometric sensors, produced exclusively using standard PCB manufacturing processes. Electrochemical detection uses standard Au and Ag electrodes together with a bespoke, low-power, multichannel, portable data-acquisition system. We demonstrate high-performance assay chemistry performed at microfluidic volumes on Au pads directly at the PCB surface with improved limit of detection (~10 pg/mL) over standard colorimetric ELISA methods. The assay has also been implemented in plasma, showing the utility of the system for medical applications. This work is a significant step towards the development of a low-cost, portable, high-precision diagnostic and monitoring technology, which once combined with appropriate PCB-based microfluidic networks will provide complete LoPCB platforms.","authors":"Daniel Evans; Konstantinos I.

{"abstract":"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is an important part of malaria control. There is a growing list of insecticide classes; pyrethroids remain the principal insecticide used in bednets but recently, novel non-pyrethroid IRS products, with contrasting impacts, have been introduced. There is an urgent need to better assess product efficacy to help decision makers choose effective and relevant tools for mosquito control. Here we use experimental hut trial data to characterise the entomological efficacy of widely-used, novel IRS insecticides. We quantify their impact against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes and use a Plasmodium falciparum transmission model to predict the public health impact of different IRS insecticides. We report that long-lasting IRS formulations substantially reduce malaria, though their benefit over cheaper, shorter-lived formulations depends on local factors including bednet use, seasonality, endemicity and pyrethroid resistance status of local mosquito populations. We provide a framework to help decision makers evaluate IRS product effectiveness. Indoor residual spraying is a commonly used method for mosquito, and malaria, control and there are a number of available insecticides that are available for this.

{"abstract":"B7H3 (CD276), a co-stimulator molecule of the cell surface B7 protein superfamily, is expressed on glioblastomas (GBM). Recently, B7H3 functions beyond immune costimulation have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms underlying B7H3 function are diverse and not well understood. GBM tumors contain undifferentiated self-renewing cells, which confound therapeutic attempts. We investigated the role of B7H3 in the regulation of GBM cell differentiation and the regulatory pathways involved. Analysis of public databases (TCGA, Rembrandt, and GEO NCBI) and RNA sequencing were performed to explore the role of B7H3 in GBM. Knockdown and overexpression of B7H3, were used to verify the downstream pathway in vitro. Further studies in vivo were performed to support the new finding. Bioinformatics analysis identified a correlation between the expression of B7H3, the expression of glioma self-renewing cell (GSC)-related genes, and MYC expression. These observations were verified by RNA-sequencing analyses in primary GBM cell lines. In vitro knockdown of B7H3-induced differentiation, associated with downregulation of SMAD6 (a TGF-β pathway inhibitor) and enhancement of SMAD1 phosphorylation-induced SMAD4 expression. Importantly, activation of the TGF-β pathway resulted in downregulation of MYC expression. In vivo assays conducted in a human GBM cell line xenograft mouse model demonstrated that B7H3 knockdown decreased MYC expression and inhibited tumor growth. B7H3 knockdown could regulate GBM differentiation by modulating MYC expression. So, B7H3 could serve as a potential theranostic target for the treatment of patients with GBM. The study reveals the novel role of B7H3, a co-stimulator molecule of the cell surface B7 protein superfamily, in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). B7H3 is synchronously upregulated with glioma self-renewing cell (GSC)-related genes. B7H3 regulates GBM differentiation through activation of the TGF-β pathway and modulation of MYC.

{"abstract":"Core–shell particles with earth-abundant cores represent an effective design strategy for improving the performance of noble metal catalysts, while simultaneously reducing the content of expensive noble metals1–4. However, the structural and catalytic stabilities of these materials often suffer during the harsh conditions encountered in important reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)3–5. Here, we demonstrate that atomically thin Pt shells stabilize titanium tungsten carbide cores, even at highly oxidizing potentials. In situ, time-resolved experiments showed how the Pt coating protects the normally labile core against oxidation and dissolution, and detailed microscopy studies revealed the dynamics of partially and fully coated core–shell nanoparticles during potential cycling. Particles with complete Pt coverage precisely maintained their core–shell structure and atomic composition during accelerated electrochemical ageing studies consisting of over 10,000 potential cycles. The exceptional durability of fully coated materials highlights the potential of core–shell architectures using earth-abundant transition metal carbide (TMC) and nitride (TMN) cores for future catalytic applications. Using core–shell particles represents an effective design strategy for improving the performance of noble metal catalysts, but their stabilities can suffer during reactions. Atomically thin Pt shells are shown to stabilize titanium tungsten carbide cores, even at highly oxidizing potentials.","authors":"Daniel Göhl; Aaron Garg; Paul Paciok; Karl J. J.

{"abstract":" The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) is a useful biomarker in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). New technological advances are helping to unravel the role of the anti-citrullinated antigen response in RA pathogenesis, in particular, the contribution of ACPAs, ACPA glycosylation and ACPA-expressing B cells. The immune response to citrullinated antigens is found almost exclusively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is a dynamic response that expands before the onset of disease and generates antibodies (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)) that are extensively glycosylated in the variable domain. This feature of ACPAs is remarkable and warrants detailed investigation, as it can offer insights into the earliest immunologic mechanisms that lead up to the development of RA. The acquisition of variable domain glycans, in fact, could enable ACPA-expressing B cells to breach tolerance. Although the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, data to support this concept are emerging, owing to the reliable identification and isolation of citrullinated antigen-directed B cells from patients with RA. This technological proficiency also allows for the generation of an increasing number of well-defined monoclonal ACPAs, and provides the opportunity to test and define the mechanisms by which the citrullinated antigen-directed B cell response contributes to the onset and persistence of inflammation. Together with a revised perception of the HLA-risk effect and novel insights into how T cells can govern antibody effector functions, these developments shape an increasingly clear picture of the B cell response to citrullinated antigens in the development of RA.","authors":"Hans Ulrich Scherer; Tom W.

{"abstract":"Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress innate immunity during bacterial lung infection. Lung-innervating nociceptor sensory neurons detect noxious or harmful stimuli and consequently protect organisms by mediating coughing, pain, and bronchoconstriction. However, the role of sensory neurons in pulmonary host defense is unclear. Here, we found that TRPV1+ nociceptors suppressed protective immunity against lethal Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Targeted TRPV1+-neuron ablation increased survival, cytokine induction, and lung bacterial clearance. Nociceptors suppressed the recruitment and surveillance of neutrophils, and altered lung γδ T cell numbers, which are necessary for immunity. Vagal ganglia TRPV1+ afferents mediated immunosuppression through release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be an effective approach to treat lung infections and bacterial pneumonia.","authors":"Pankaj Baral; Benjamin D Umans; Lu Li; Antonia Wallrapp; Meghna Bist; Talia Kirschbaum; Yibing Wei; Yan Zhou; Vijay K Kuchroo; Patrick R Burkett; Bryan G Yipp; Stephen D Liberles; Isaac M Chiu","keywords":"Bacteria; Infectious diseases; Neuroimmunology","organization_affiliated":"Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Critical Care, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Critical Care, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","title":"Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and γδ T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia","id":"62f6d07e-beda-46f3-ab45-ce561fb89ae1"}
{"abstract":"Excessive inflammation can cause damage to host cells and tissues. Thus, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines is tightly regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels and influenced by cellular stress responses, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or apoptosis. Here, we describe a novel type of post-transcriptional regulation of the type-I-IFN response that was induced in monocytes by cytosolic transfection of a short immunomodulatory DNA (imDNA), a G-tetrad forming CpG-free derivative of the TLR9 agonist ODN2216. When co-transfected with cytosolic nucleic acid stimuli (DNA or 3P-dsRNA), imDNA induced caspase-3 activation, translational shutdown and upregulation of stress-induced genes. This stress response inhibited the type-I-IFN induction at the translational level. By contrast, the induction of most type-I-IFN-associated chemokines, including Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Ligand (CXCL)10 was not affected, suggesting a differential translational regulation of chemokines and type-I-IFN. Pan-caspase inhibitors could restore IFN-β secretion, yet, strikingly, caspase inhibition did not restore global translation but instead induced a compensatory increase in the transcription of IFN-β but not CXCL10. Altogether, our data provide evidence for a differential regulation of cytokine release at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels which suppresses type-I-IFN induction yet allows for CXCL10 secretion during imDNA-induced cellular stress.","authors":"Anna-Maria Herzner; Steven Wolter; Thomas Zillinger; Saskia Schmitz; Winfried Barchet; Gunther Hartmann; Eva Bartok; Martin Schlee","keywords":"Chemokines; Gene regulation in immune cells; Innate immunity; Interferons","organization_affiliated":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Cologne-Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Cologne-Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany","title":"G-rich DNA-induced stress response blocks type-I-IFN but not CXCL10 secretion in monocytes","id":"9ad173ca-0859-45ba-bf5c-8b5749d0a088"}

An increase in the temperature (T = 20–40 °C) increases their adsorption rate constant values (k1) by 2.5 fold but has a negligible effect on the amount of antioxidant adsorbed per mass of AC at equilibrium.

{"abstract":"The locations of objects in our environment constitute arguably the most important piece of information our visual system must convey to facilitate successful visually guided behaviour. However, the relevant objects are usually not point-like and do not have one unique location attribute. Relatively little is known about how the visual system represents the location of such large objects as visual processing is, both on neural and perceptual level, highly edge dominated. In this study, human observers made saccades to the centres of luminance defined squares (width 4 deg), which appeared at random locations (8 deg eccentricity). The phase structure of the square was manipulated such that the points of maximum luminance gradient at the square’s edges shifted from trial to trial. The average saccade endpoints of all subjects followed those shifts in remarkable quantitative agreement. Further experiments showed that the shifts were caused by the edge manipulations, not by changes in luminance structure near the centre of the square or outside the square. We conclude that the human visual system programs saccades to large luminance defined square objects based on edge locations derived from the points of maximum luminance gradients at the square’s edges.","authors":"Markku Kilpeläinen; Mark A.

{"abstract":"ABO, Lewis and secretor histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) are susceptibility factors for rotavirus in a P-genotype dependent manner and can influence IgA seroconversion rates following rotavirus vaccination. To investigate the association between HBGA phenotypes and rotavirus vaccine shedding fecal samples (n = 304) from a total of 141 infants vaccinated with Rotarix (n = 71) and RotaTeq (n = 70) were prospectively sampled in three time frames (≤3, 4–7 and ≥8 days) after first vaccination dose. Rotavirus was detected with qPCR and genotypes determined by G/P multiplex PCR and/or sequencing. HBGAs were determined by hemagglutination and saliva based ELISA. Low shedding rates were observed, with slightly more children vaccinated with RotaTeq (19%) than Rotarix (11%) shedding rotavirus at ≥4 days post vaccination (DPV). At ≥4 DPV no infant of Lewis A (n = 6) or nonsecretor (n = 9) phenotype in the Rotarix cohort shed rotavirus; the same observation was made for Lewis A infants (n = 7) in the RotaTeq cohort. Putative in-vivo gene reassortment among RotaTeq strains occurred, yielding mainly G1P[8] strains. The bovine derived P[5] genotype included in RotaTeq was able to replicate and be shed at long time frames (\u003e13 DPV). The results of this study are consistent with that HBGA phenotype influences vaccine strain shedding as similarly observed for natural infections. Due to the low overall shedding rates observed, additional studies are however warranted.","authors":"Filemón Bucardo; Yaoska Reyes; Ylva Rönnelid; Fredman González; Sumit Sharma; Lennart Svensson; Johan Nordgren","keywords":"Gastroenteritis; Genetic markers; Live attenuated vaccines","organization_affiliated":"Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Science, National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, León (UNAN-León), León, Nicaragua; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Science, National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, León (UNAN-León), León, Nicaragua; Division of Molecular Virology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Science, National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, León (UNAN-León), León, Nicaragua; Division of Molecular Virology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden; Division of Molecular Virology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden; Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; Division of Molecular Virology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","title":"Histo-blood group antigens and rotavirus vaccine shedding in Nicaraguan infants","id":"d60559c3-50a4-4ed4-b6f2-4637786eeb15"}
{"abstract":"Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding and endogenous key regulators that play significant functions in regulating plant responses to stress, and plant growth and development. Heat stress is a critical abiotic stress that reduces the yield and quality of flowering Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. utilis Tsen et Lee). However, limited information is available on whether miRNAs are involved in the regulation of heat stress in B. campestris. A high-throughput sequencing approach was used to identify novel and conserved heat-responsive miRNAs in four small RNA libraries of flowering Chinese cabbage using leaves collected at 0 h, 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after a 38 °C heat-stress treatment. The analysis identified 41 conserved miRNAs (belonging to 19 MIR families), of which MIR156, MIR159, MIR168, MIR171 and MIR1885 had the most abundant molecules. Prediction and evaluation of novel miRNAs using the unannotated reads resulted in 18 candidate miRNAs. Differential expression analysis showed that most of the identified miRNAs were downregulated in heat-treated groups. To better understand functional importance, bioinformatic analysis predicted 432 unique putative target miRNAs involved in cells, cell parts, catalytic activity, cellular processes and abiotic stress responses. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes maps of flowering Chinese cabbage identified the significant role of miRNAs in stress adaptation and stress tolerance, and in several mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways including cell death. This work presents a comprehensive study of the miRNAs for understanding the regulatory mechanisms and their participation in the heat stress of flowering Chinese cabbage.","authors":"Waqas Ahmed; Yanshi Xia; Hua Zhang; Ronghua Li; Guihua Bai; Kadambot H.

{"abstract":"Photoreceptor death is the root cause of vision loss in many retinal disorders, and there is an unmet need for neuroprotective modalities to improve photoreceptor survival. The biosynthetic requirement of photoreceptors is among the highest in the body, and to meet this demand, photoreceptors maintain their ability to perform aerobic glycolysis. This highly regulated form of glycolysis allows cells to efficiently budget their metabolic needs and may be a critical link between photoreceptor function and survival. Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) is a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis. In the present study, we characterized the effect of PKM2 deletion on baseline functioning and survival of photoreceptors over time by utilizing a photoreceptor-specific, PKM2 knockout mouse model. We found that upon PKM2 deletion, PKM1 is upregulated in the outer retina and there is increased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, which led to chronic degenerative changes in the outer retina of these mice. We also discovered that this metabolic reprogramming provided a survival advantage to photoreceptors in an experimental model of retinal detachment. This study strongly supports the hypothesis that reprogramming metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for photoreceptor neuroprotection during acute stress.","authors":"Thomas J.

{"abstract":"An emerging paradigm proposes a crucial role for lung resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) via a fibroblastic transdifferentiation event in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs in virtually all fibrotic lung diseases and is relevant to the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In vitro, by measuring the protein levels of several key components involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we confirmed that this signaling pathway was activated in the myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs. Targeted inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by a small molecule, ICG-001, dose-dependently impeded the proliferation and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-mediated fibrogenic actions of LR-MSCs. In vivo, ICG-001 exerted its lung protective effects after bleomycin treatment through blocking mesenchymal-myofibroblast transition, repressing matrix gene expression, and reducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, delayed administration of ICG-001 attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, which may present a promising therapeutic strategy for intervention of IPF. Interestingly, these antifibrotic actions of ICG-001 are operated by a mechanism independent of any disruption of Smad activation. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may be an essential mechanism underlying the regulation of myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs and their further participation in the development of pulmonary fibrosis.","authors":"Honghui Cao; Cong Wang; Xiang Chen; Jiwei Hou; Zou Xiang; Yi Shen; Xiaodong Han","keywords":"Cystic fibrosis; Extracellular signalling molecules","organization_affiliated":"Immunology and Reproduction Biology Laboratory \u0026 State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Discovery for Metabolic Diseases, Center of New Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing, China; Immunology and Reproduction Biology Laboratory \u0026 State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Immunology and Reproduction Biology Laboratory \u0026 State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Nanjing, China; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Immunology and Reproduction Biology Laboratory \u0026 State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","title":"Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses myofibroblast differentiation of lung resident mesenchymal stem cells and pulmonary fibrosis","id":"6050be08-177c-4453-8d0a-d920608793be"}

{"abstract":"Recently, liposomes-microbubble conjugates have emerged as a promising ultrasound (US)-responsive platform for cancer therapeutics. However, these are limited by their size in terms of tumor penetration. Additionally, there have been no attempts to enhance the smartness of such conjugates which have been used only as passive carriers. The present study explores submicron sized (756 ± 180.0 nm), US-responsive, phosphatidylserine (PS)-based paclitaxel-liposomes-nanobubble conjugates (PSPLBC) with an additional pro-apoptotic effect towards enhanced anti-cancer efficacy and image-guidance. The developed PSPLBC underwent cavitation in response to US-trigger, exhibiting in vitro pulsatile release with a 10-fold increase in cellular internalization as compared to control. The PS-containing formulations were found to be pro-apoptotic and exhibited strong synergism between PS and paclitaxel (Combination Index, CI \u003c 0.1). This resulted in significantly high anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo conditions (98.3 ± 0.8% tumor growth inhibition, TGI). Significant reduction in tumor proliferation index and MVD, as well as significant increase in apoptosis, were observed for the treated tumor sections. Further, the intravenous (i.v.) administration of PSPLBC enhanced the tumor US-contrast by 2-fold as compared to SonoVue. These results, show the potential of PSPLBC as a promising non-invasive, pro-apoptotic, smart DDS for US-responsive, image-guided cancer therapeutics.","authors":"Rajeet Chandan; Rinti Banerjee","keywords":"Cancer imaging; Targeted therapies","organization_affiliated":"Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India; Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India","title":"Pro-apoptotic liposomes-nanobubble conjugate synergistic with paclitaxel: a platform for ultrasound responsive image-guided drug delivery","id":"c8e57257-c074-4e97-b8c5-bd86a1eb8835"}
{"abstract":"Skeletal muscle insulin resistance, decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and altered mitochondrial function are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. To determine the relationship between these abnormalities, we created mice with muscle-specific knockout of the p110α or p110β catalytic subunits of PI3K. We find that mice with muscle-specific knockout of p110α, but not p110β, display impaired insulin signaling and reduced muscle size due to enhanced proteasomal and autophagic activity. Despite insulin resistance and muscle atrophy, M-p110αKO mice show decreased serum myostatin, increased mitochondrial mass, increased mitochondrial fusion, and increased PGC1α expression, especially PCG1α2 and PCG1α3. This leads to enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity, increased muscle NADH content, and higher muscle free radical release measured in vivo using pMitoTimer reporter. Thus, p110α is the dominant catalytic isoform of PI3K in muscle in control of insulin sensitivity and muscle mass, and has a unique role in mitochondrial homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Diabetes is associated with decreased PI3K activation in skeletal muscle. Here, the authors show that p110a is the predominant PI3K subunit in muscle, and show that its ablation in muscle, but not ablation of p110beta, leads to insulin resistance, increased proteosomal and autophagic activity, and altered mitochondria homeostasis in mice.","authors":"Mengyao Ella Li; Hans P.

{"abstract":"We demonstrate that in a standard thermo-electric nanodevice the current and heat flows are not only dictated by the temperature and potential gradient, but also by the external action of a local quantum observer that controls the coherence of the device. Depending on how and where the observation takes place, the direction of heat and particle currents can be independently controlled. In fact, we show that the current and heat flow in a quantum material can go against the natural temperature and voltage gradients. Dynamical quantum observation offers new possibilities for the control of quantum transport far beyond classical thermal reservoirs. Through the concept of local projections, we illustrate how we can create and directionality control the injection of currents (electronic and heat) in nanodevices. This scheme provides novel strategies to construct quantum devices with application in thermoelectrics, spintronic injection, phononics, and sensing among others. In particular, highly efficient and selective spin injection might be achieved by local spin projection techniques. The presence of a quantum observer, acting locally in a thermoelectric nanodevice, is shown to be enough to change its heat and electronic transport path. In quantum mechanics the observation of a phenomenon can affect its outcome. Local quantum observation of a system can induce continuous and dynamic changes in its quantum coherence, thus providing another level of control of its properties. Angel Rubio and colleagues study theoretically this idea in a nanodevice whose left and right side are connected to hot and thermal baths, respectively; this configuration forces the energy and particles to flow clockwise. Introduction of a quantum observer however, induces a counter-clockwise particle ring-current due to the localized electronic state and symmetry breaking of the system. Such heat flow control might prove useful for spintronics, quantum phononics, and sensing devices.","authors":"Robert Biele; César A.

{"abstract":"Oxidative stress in renal mesangial cell causes diabetic glomerular changes. High glucose levels and angiotensin II (Ang II) are known to stimulate superoxide production in renal mesangial cells. However, it has been unclear whether Ang II stimulation and pre-conditioning with high glucose affects the same pathway of superoxide production in renal mesangial cells or not. In this study, we examined the levels of oxidative stress under Ang II stimulation in renal mesangial cells preincubated for six hours at various glucose levels. Intracellular levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) were measured using dihydroethidium or 5′,6′-chloromethyl- 2′,7′ dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate, which facilitates the detection of intracellular ROS under real-time fluorescent microscope. Ang II-induced elevated intracellular ROS levels were detected only when the cells were pre-incubated with high levels of glucose (13.5 mM, 27.8 mM), but was not detected under normal glucose condition (5.5 mM). Production of Ang II-induced intracellular ROS was higher under pre-treatment with 27.8 mM glucose compared to pretreatment with 13.5 mM glucose level. This ROS production in mesangial cells was induced within several minutes of the initiation of Ang II stimulation under high glucose levels. The production of intracellular ROS was significantly reduced in the presence of angiotensin II type1-receptor (AT1R) antagonist, whereas it was augmented in the presence of angiotensin II type2-receptor antagonist. In conclusion, Ang II-induced oxidative stress was augmented by high glucose levels and ROS levels were further alleviated in the presence of AT1R antagonists.","authors":"Tetsuya Akaishi; Michiaki Abe; Hiroshi Okuda; Kota Ishizawa; Takaaki Abe; Tadashi Ishii; Sadayoshi Ito","keywords":"Diabetic nephropathy; Mechanisms of disease","organization_affiliated":"Department of Education and Support for Regional Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Department of Education and Support for Regional Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Division of Nephrology, Endocrinology and Vascular Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Department of Education and Support for Regional Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Department of Education and Support for Regional Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Division of Nephrology, Endocrinology and Vascular Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Department of Education and Support for Regional Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; Division of Nephrology, Endocrinology and Vascular Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan","title":"High glucose level and angiotensin II type 1 receptor stimulation synergistically amplify oxidative stress in renal mesangial cells","id":"9bd01776-394b-4652-a55b-b33c8586348c"}
{"abstract":"Breastfeeding is related to maternal health. However, the association of women’s breastfeeding duration with cognitive function in their later life is limited and inconsistent. The aim of this study was to accurately evaluate the association in Chinese postmenopausal women. We analyzed the data from Zhejiang Ageing and Health Cohort Study including 5487 postmenopausal women. Cognitive impairment was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data on breastfeeding duration was collected in the reproductive history section within the questionnaire. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression models, controlled for an extensive range of potential confounders, were generated to examine the associations. A U-shaped association was identified between breastfeeding duration and cognitive impairment based on GAM. The nadir with lowest odds of cognitive impairment was ascertained by quadratic model as 12 months. The logistic models showed that compared with women breastfeeding 12 months per child, the fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.50 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.20–1.88), 1.58 (95% CI: 1.29–1.93), 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06–1.68), 2.08 (95% CI: 1.64–2.65) for those averagely breastfeeding \u003c6, 6-\u003c12,\u003e12–18,\u003e18 months, respectively.

It is caused by aberrant synchronized firing of populations of neurons primarily due to imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Hence, the historical focus of epilepsy research has been neurocentric. However, the past two decades have enjoyed an explosion of research into the role of glia in supporting and modulating neuronal activity, providing compelling evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. The mechanisms by which glia, particularly astrocytes and microglia, may contribute to epilepsy and consequently could be harnessed therapeutically are discussed in this Review. The role of glia in supporting and modulating neuronal activity has been an active area of research.

{"abstract":"Forced solar gazing (FSG) appears to be more regularly employed as a method of torture in certain parts of the world than has previously been documented. This study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009–2019. All clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients’ associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity. FSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases.

{"abstract":"Excessive phosphorus intake adversely affects bone and mineral metabolism. Estrogen is one of the factors affecting fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a phosphorus-regulating hormone. However, the interaction between excess phosphorus and estrogen status has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the involvement of estrogen in the effects of high phosphorus intake on bone metabolism and ectopic calcification in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The interaction between high phosphorus diet and OVX was not observed in bone mineral density and aortic calcium. In contrast, high phosphorus intake markedly increased renal calcium concentration in sham rats, whereas the effect was attenuated in OVX rats, which was reversed by a selective estrogen-receptor modulator treatment. A strong positive correlation between renal calcium and serum FGF23 was observed. In addition, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1: a predominant receptor of FGF23) inhibitor treatment partially decreased renal calcium concentrations in rats with high phosphorus intake. In conclusion, the effect of high phosphorus intake on bone metabolism and aortic calcification did not depend on the estrogen status; in contrast, high phosphorus intake synergistically induced nephrocalcinosis in the presence of estrogenic action on the bone. Furthermore, FGF23 was involved in the nephrocalcinosis induced by high phosphorus intake partially through FGFR1 signaling.","authors":"Satoshi Takasugi; Miho Shioyama; Masami Kitade; Masashi Nagata; Taketo Yamaji","keywords":"Endocrinology; Phosphorus metabolism disorders","organization_affiliated":"Division of Research and Development, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Division of Research and Development, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Division of Research and Development, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Division of Research and Development, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Division of Research and Development, Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan","title":"Involvement of estrogen in phosphorus-induced nephrocalcinosis through fibroblast growth factor 23","id":"c49ed801-152e-46f7-9827-0124ebda2325"}
{"abstract":" Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a significant cause of severe nosocomial pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals world-wide. With limited treatment options available, a better understanding of host immnity to A. baumannii infection is critical to devise alternative control strategies. Our previous study has identified that intracellular Nod1/Nod2 signaling pathway is required for the immune control of A. baumannii in airway epithelial cells in vitro. In the current study, using Nod2−/− mice and an in vivo sublethal model of pulmonary infection, we show that Nod2 contributes to the early lung defense against A. baumannii infection through reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production as Nod2−/− mice showed significantly reduced production of ROS/RNS in the lungs following A. baumannii infection. Consistent with the higher bacterial load, A. baumannii-induced neutrophil recruitment, cytokine/chemokine response and lung pathology was also exacerbated in Nod2−/− mice at early time points post-infection. Finally, we show that administration of Nod2 ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) prior to infection protected the wild- type mice from A. baumannii pulmonary challenge. Collectively, Nod2 is an important player in the early lung immunity against A. baumannii and modulating Nod2 pathway could be considered as a viable therapeutic strategy to control A. baumannii pulmonary infection.","authors":"Sandeep D.

{"abstract":"Chemo-PTT, which combines chemotherapy with photothermal therapy, offers a viable approach for the complete tumor eradication but would likely fail in drug-resistant situations if conventional chemotherapeutic agents are used. Here we show that a type of copper (Cu)-palladium (Pd) alloy tetrapod nanoparticles (TNP-1) presents an ideal solution to the chemo-PTT challenges. TNP-1 exhibit superior near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency, thanks to their special sharp-tip structure, and induce pro-survival autophagy in a shape- and composition-dependent manner. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine or chloroquine has a remarkable synergistic effect on TNP-1-mediated PTT in triple-negative (4T1), drug-resistant (MCF7/MDR) and patient-derived breast cancer models, achieving a level of efficacy unattainable with TNP-2, the identically-shaped CuPd nanoparticles that have a higher photothermal conversion efficiency but no autophagy-inducing activity. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for a chemo-PTT strategy, which utilizes autophagy inhibitors instead of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and is particularly useful for eradicating drug-resistant cancer. “Conventional chemotherapy-photothermal therapy combination has limited efficacy in drug resistant cancers.

{"abstract":"Long term monitoring of locomotor behaviour in humans using body-worn sensors can provide insight into the dynamical structure of locomotion, which can be used for quantitative, predictive and classification analyses in a biomedical context. A frequently used approach to study daily life locomotor behaviour in different population groups involves categorisation of locomotion into various states as a basis for subsequent analyses of differences in locomotor behaviour. In this work, we use such a categorisation to develop two feature sets, namely state probability and transition rates between states, and use supervised classification techniques to demonstrate differences in locomotor behaviour. We use this to study the influence of various states in differentiating between older adults with and without dementia. We further assess the contribution of each state and transition and identify the states most influential in maximising the classification accuracy between the two groups. The methods developed here are general and can be applied to areas dealing with categorical time series.","authors":"Sayantan Ghosh; Tim Fleiner; Eleftheria Giannouli; Uwe Jaekel; Sabato Mellone; Peter Häussermann; Wiebren Zijlstra","keywords":"Geriatrics; Machine learning","organization_affiliated":"German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Movement and Sport Gerontology, Cologne, Germany; University of Applied Sciences Koblenz RheinAhrCampus, Faculty of Mathematics and Technology, Remagen, Germany; German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Movement and Sport Gerontology, Cologne, Germany; LVR Hospital Cologne, Academic Teaching Hospital of the University of Cologne, Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany; German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Movement and Sport Gerontology, Cologne, Germany; University of Applied Sciences Koblenz RheinAhrCampus, Faculty of Mathematics and Technology, Remagen, Germany; University of Bologna, Dept. of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, Bologna, Italy; LVR Hospital Cologne, Academic Teaching Hospital of the University of Cologne, Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Cologne, Germany; German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Movement and Sport Gerontology, Cologne, Germany","title":"Statistical learning of mobility patterns from long-term monitoring of locomotor behaviour with body-worn sensors","id":"7eea5bd6-12b0-4b52-b747-40384f23698b"}
{"abstract":"To examine the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of implementing pharmacogenomics (PGx) in cardiovascular disease (CVD) care. We conducted a systematic review using multiple databases from inception to 2018. The titles and abstracts of cost-effectiveness studies on PGx-guided treatment in CVD care were screened, and full texts were extracted. We screened 909 studies and included 46 to synthesize. Acute coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation were the predominantly studied conditions (59%). Most studies (78%) examined warfarin–CYP2C9/VKORC1 or clopidogrel–CYP2C19. A payer’s perspective was commonly used (39%) for cost calculations, and most studies (46%) were US-based. The majority (67%) of the studies found PGx testing to be cost-effective in CVD care, but cost-effectiveness varied across drugs and conditions. Two studies examined PGx panel testing, of which one examined pre-emptive testing strategies. We found mixed evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PGx in CVD care. Supportive evidence exists for clopidogrel–CYP2C19 and warfarin–CYP2C9/VKORC1, but evidence is limited in other drug–gene combinations. Gaps persist, including unclear explanation of perspective and cost inputs, underreporting of study design elements critical to economic evaluations, and limited examination of PGx panel and pre-emptive testing for their cost-effectiveness. This review identifies the need for further research on economic evaluations of PGx implementation.","authors":"Ye Zhu; Kristi M. Swanson; Ricardo L. Rojas; Zhen Wang; Jennifer L. St. Sauver; Sue L.

{"abstract":"Soft robots hold promise for well-matched interactions with delicate objects, humans and unstructured environments owing to their intrinsic material compliance. Movement and stiffness modulation, which is challenging yet needed for an effective demonstration, can be devised by drawing inspiration from plants. Plants use a coordinated and reversible modulation of intracellular turgor (pressure) to tune their stiffness and achieve macroscopic movements. Plant-inspired osmotic actuation was recently proposed, yet reversibility is still an open issue hampering its implementation, also in soft robotics. Here we show a reversible osmotic actuation strategy based on the electrosorption of ions on flexible porous carbon electrodes driven at low input voltages (1.3 V). We demonstrate reversible stiffening (~5-fold increase) and actuation (~500 deg rotation) of a tendril-like soft robot (diameter ~1 mm). Our approach highlights the potential of plant-inspired technologies for developing soft robots based on biocompatible materials and safe voltages making them appealing for prospective applications. Plant-inspired osmotic actuation has been proposed as a competitive actuation strategy yet reversibility is still an open issue hampering its implementation in soft robotics. Here the authors show a low input voltage reversible osmotic actuation strategy based on the electrosorption of ions on flexible electrodes.","authors":"Indrek Must; Edoardo Sinibaldi; Barbara Mazzolai","keywords":"Actuators; Mechanical engineering; Polymers","organization_affiliated":"Center for Micro-BioRobotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Pontedera, Italy; Institute of Technology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia; Center for Micro-BioRobotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Pontedera, Italy; Center for Micro-BioRobotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Pontedera, Italy","title":"A variable-stiffness tendril-like soft robot based on reversible osmotic actuation","id":"aaea7e9a-f2a2-435b-8cf2-b3c77a0d2267"}
{"abstract":"PG545 (pixatimod) is a novel immunomodulatory agent, which has been demonstrated to stimulate innate immune responses against tumours in preclinical cancer models. This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of PG545 monotherapy. Escalating doses of PG545 were administered to patients with advanced solid malignancies as a weekly 1-h intravenous infusion. Twenty-three subjects were enrolled across four cohorts (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg). Three dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)—hypertension (2), epistaxis (1)—occurred in the 150 mg cohort. No DLTs were noted in the 100 mg cohort, which was identified as the maximum-tolerated dose. No objective responses were reported. Best response was stable disease up to 24 weeks, with the disease control rate in evaluable subjects of 38%. Exposure was proportional up to 100 mg and mean half-life was 141 h. The pharmacodynamic data revealed increases in innate immune cell activation, plasma IFNγ, TNFα, IP-10 and MCP-1. PG545 demonstrated a tolerable safety profile, proportional PK, evidence of immune cell stimulation and disease control in some subjects. Taken together, these data support the proposed mechanism of action, which represents a promising approach for use in combination with existing therapies.","authors":"Keith Dredge; Todd V.

{"abstract":"Most imaging studies of immunotherapy have focused on tracking labeled T cell biodistribution in vivo for understanding trafficking and homing parameters and predicting therapeutic efficacy by the presence of transferred T cells at or in the tumour mass. Conversely, we investigate here a novel concept for longitudinally elucidating anatomical and pathophysiological changes of solid tumours after adoptive T cell transfer in a preclinical set up, using previously unexplored in-tandem macroscopic and mesoscopic optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging. We show non-invasive in vivo observations of vessel collapse during tumour rejection across entire tumours and observe for the first time longitudinal tumour rejection in a label-free manner based on optical absorption changes in the tumour mass due to cellular decline. We complement these observations with high resolution episcopic fluorescence imaging of T cell biodistribution using optimized T cell labeling based on two near-infrared dyes targeting the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. We discuss how optoacoustic macroscopy and mesoscopy offer unique contrast and immunotherapy insights, allowing label-free and longitudinal observations of tumour therapy. The results demonstrate optoacoustic imaging as an invaluable tool in understanding and optimizing T cell therapy.","authors":"Melanie A.

{"abstract":"The authors performed a retrospective and comparative study to compare the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept and bevacizumab for patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). The patients with treatment-naïve mCNV received 1 + PRN intravitreal bevacizumab from March 2008 to February 2013, while from March 2013 to July 2016 patients were treated by 1 + PRN intravitreal aflibercept, all with monthly follow-up for 12 months. Primary outcome measures included change in central foveal thickness (CFT) in 1 mm by spectral-domain optic coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at month 12. Complications after injections were recorded. The intra-group changes in CFT and BCVA were compared with Wilcoxon signed rank test, the between-group difference compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical comparison between groups. Seventy-eight eyes of 78 patients were collected. There were 42 eyes in bevacizumab group, with mean age of 53.2 ± 5.4 years and 27 female patients of them. The mean BCVA significantly improved from baseline 0.56 ± 0.35 logMAR to 0.35 ± 0.35 logMAR at Month 12 after bevacizumab treatment (p \u003c 0.001). The mean CFT significantly decreased from baseline 315.3 ± 25.6 μm to 253.7 ± 24.4 μm at Month 12 following intravitreal bevacizumab (p \u003c 0.001). There were 36 eyes in aflibercept group, with mean age of 52.8 ± 6.8 years and 24 female patients of them. The mean BCVA significantly improved from baseline 0.61 ± 0.47 logMAR to 0.38 ± 0.41 logMAR at Month 12 after aflibercept treatment (p \u003c 0.001). The mean CFT significantly decreased from baseline 328.2 ± 19.8 μm to 241.8 ± 27.2 μm at Month 12 following intravitreal aflibercept (p \u003c 0.001). The baseline demographics, lens status, axial length, refractive errors, duration of symptoms, BCVA, and CFT did not differ significantly between groups (p \u003e 0.05). There was no significant difference between bevacizumab and aflibercept groups in BCVA and CFT from Month 1 to Month 12 (p \u003e 0.05). Injection number of aflibercept was 2.11 ± 0.41, less than that of bevacizumab (3.23 ± 0.38) during 12-month period (p = 0.01). There were no systemic thromboembolic event, elevated intraocular pressure, retinal detachment, or infectious endophthalmitis following injections in both groups. We concluded that both aflibercept and bevacizumab can effectively treat choroidal neovascularization in high myopes. Intravitreal aflibercept had similar efficacy but less treatment number than bevacizumab for mCNV during 12-month period.","authors":"Jia-Kang Wang; Tzu-Lun Huang; Pei-Yao Chang; Yen-Ting Chen; Chin-Wei Chang; Fang-Ting Chen; Yung-Ray Hsu; Yun-Ju Chen","keywords":"Macular degeneration; Pharmaceutics","organization_affiliated":"Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of electrical engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Yang Ming University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Healthcare Administration and Department of Nursing, Oriental Institute of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of electrical engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Yang Ming University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan","title":"Intravitreal aflibercept versus bevacizumab for treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization","id":"d1a6c941-39cf-4eeb-8f9d-c31d9440e6b7"}
